2053	20	A	um, what kind of hobbies do you have?
2053	4	B	um, i do a lot of cross-stitching and painting, when i do have spare time.
2053	6	A	really,
2053	4	A	i like cross-stitch too.
2053	4	B	oh, i love it.
2053	4	A	i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately.
2053	3	B	that's my case also.
2053	4	B	i've got a new born
2053	4	B	and there's just no time.
2053	6	A	uh-huh.
2053	13	B	have you been cross-stitching long?
2053	4	A	oh, several years.
2053	4	A	my husband is even interested in it now.
2053	4	A	he likes to help me design, um, you know, projects that are,
2053	6	B	oh, really.
2053	7	A	a little more customized.
2053	4	B	mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern
2053	4	B	and he says how do you get that from there to the material .
2053	2	A	not that hard.
2053	3	B	oh, it's not.
2053	4	A	i really enjoy it.
2053	4	B	and once you get started on it, it's just, oh, i just, i love it. / *two utts
2053	6	A	uh-huh.
2053	4	B	i do a lot of my own patterns also.
2053	6	A	yeah.
2053	4	B	in fact, i did one, bill the cat, you know, from glenn county
2053	6	A	oh, yeah.
2053	7	B	that, uh, was a real good one to do.
2053	4	B	it was tough,
2053	5	B	but, uh, yeah.
2053	13	B	do you have any others,
2053	13	B	or is this mainly cross-stitching?
2053	4	A	um, i do mostly that, um,
2053	4	A	not very artistic really for like painting and stuff.
2053	6	B	oh, uh-huh.
2053	5	B	um,
2053	4	A	but, now i don't know.
2053	7	B	yeah.
2053	4	B	i'm still trying to get all the d m c colors .
2053	6	A	oh, really .
2053	6	A	yeah,
2053	4	A	i've got the kits to put them all in.
2053	4	A	i don't have them all yet
2053	3	B	yeah,
2053	3	B	right.
2053	3	B	yeah.
2053	7	A	certainly.
2053	6	B	yeah.
2053	4	B	i got to counting the other day
2053	4	B	and, uh, i think i have, what was it two hundred,
2053	4	B	and i got to thinking the money that i've got invested in this is, uh,
2053	4	B	it, yeah, it can add up quick.
2053	3	A	oh, yeah.
2053	4	A	i just, i just keep an inventory of what i currently have,
2053	4	A	and then when i start a new project, i go through and see if i, if i, you know,
2053	4	A	just buy the colors that i need
2053	6	B	uh-huh.
2053	7	A	of what i'm low on.
2053	6	B	right.
2053	9	B	i see.
2053	4	B	well, now can i improvise with adding and using another color instead, you know, what comes close.
2053	6	A	uh-huh.
2053	7	B	because a lot of them are similar.
2053	3	A	yeah.
2053	2	A	a lot of times you can do that.
2053	5	A	i think, i
2053	4	A	the pinks, there's like forty-two different shades of pink.
2053	9	B	good grief .
2053	6	B	yeah,
2053	4	B	there's lots of # pinks and greens. #
2053	30	A	# pinks and greens. #
2053	6	A	yeah.
2053	4	B	there's lots of shades of greens.
2053	5	B	but the colors,
2053	4	B	i just love all the different colors.
2053	6	A	yeah.
2053	4	B	they had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to.
2053	13	B	but, you don't have much spare time either?
2053	36	A	well, not lately .
2053	4	A	i just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there.
2053	14	B	oh, yes.
2053	2	B	and that does take some time.
2053	4	B	and if we're trying to get acclimated with the, uh, with having a baby,
2053	5	B	and .
2053	6	A	yeah.
2053	20	A	how old?
2053	4	B	he's seven months old.
2053	6	A	oh, yeah.
2053	4	B	and just into everything,
2053	4	B	so there's not a spare moment.
2053	16	A	<Laughter>.
2053	4	B	oh, but i wouldn't trade it for the world.
2053	4	B	i've been trying to do some bibs for him.
2053	6	A	oh, yeah.
2053	7	B	and, uh, work on his christmas stocking.
2053	6	A	yeah.
2053	4	B	we missed it last year,
2053	4	B	so hopefully this year he'll have one.
2053	6	A	yeah.
2053	2	A	well, last year he was a little bit young for having one.
2053	3	B	right.
2053	2	A	he wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway .
2053	16	B	. .
2053	2	A	you would have
2053	5	A	but,
2053	3	B	right.
2053	4	B	if it tasted good, yeah.
2053	4	B	all he liked was the lights this year,
2053	5	B	so.
2053	6	A	oh, yeah.
2053	9	B	oh, well, that's neat that you like cross-stitching also.
2053	3	A	yeah,
2053	2	A	that's, that's kind of strange that we got the same call.
2053	6	B	yeah.
2053	2	A	it's a call.
2053	10	B	oh, i'm sorry.
2053	11	B	go ahead.
2053	31	A	no,
2053	40	A	that's okay.
2053	3	B	okay , uh,
2053	5	B	but, yeah,
2053	4	B	i've been doing it for probably ten years or so.
2053	9	A	oh, wow.
2053	5	A	no,
2053	4	A	i just started about, well, five years ago, i think.
2053	2	B	but it is peaceful,
2053	2	B	i mean it is relaxing to do, once you find the time to do it.
2053	6	A	uh-huh .
2053	4	A	there's also a couple of large projects, baby afghans,
2053	4	A	and i got one done
2053	4	A	and i think the other one is going. the child is going to be in high school before i get finished.
2053	5	B	on that, uh --
2053	5	A	bear thing .
2053	13	B	is it one of those afghans that i've seen in the packages with the, with the large squares?
2053	19	A	well, yeah
2053	4	A	i just, i bought the cloth and the pattern for it.
2053	4	A	i didn't, um, i didn't buy the, uh, i didn't buy a kit.
2053	6	B	oh, uh-huh.
2053	4	B	well i've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching.
2053	6	A	uh-huh.
2053	4	A	it's that cloth.
2053	14	B	oh, okay.
2053	4	A	it's an-, cloth i think.
2053	6	B	uh-huh.
2053	4	A	and it has the borders and everything already.
2053	6	B	yeah.
2053	9	B	those are pretty.
2053	4	A	number one turned out just great,
2053	4	A	and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that i had done it in the colors, that they had decorated the nursery
2053	4	A	and i didn't even know it.
2053	9	B	oh, that's a .
2053	4	A	i gave it to her
2053	4	A	and she said how did you know those are the colors we used.
2053	4	A	i said  didn't .
2053	9	B	that was a good .
2053	4	A	it worked out that way.
2053	9	B	that's great.
2053	5	B	uh, that, uh,
2053	4	B	now i've got the material to do an afghan that i just never did get around to finishing it.
2053	6	A	uh-huh.
2053	4	B	i like those.
2053	2	B	those are pretty.
2053	6	A	yeah.
2053	4	A	lilly, lilly , she said, she said it's for your daughter to use.
2053	31	A	oh, no.
2053	4	A	she said, i know she doesn't get to touch it.
2053	4	A	she hung it on the wall.
2053	6	B	yes,
2053	4	B	my, uh, grandmother, um, made us a couple of quilts for the baby,
2053	4	B	and i was like, oh, i don't want to mess those up.
2053	6	A	yeah .
2053	2	B	uh, they're just too nice.
2053	2	B	i mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore.
2053	6	A	yeah.
2053	6	B	oh, yeah.
2053	3	A	true.
2053	12	B	well, i've enjoyed this.
2053	12	A	okay.
2053	12	B	but, uh, well keep up the good, um,
2053	12	B	keep up the cross-stitching.
2053	12	A	you too.
2053	12	B	all right,
2053	12	B	thanks.
2053	12	A	# uh-huh,
2053	12	A	bye bye. #
2053	12	B	# bye bye. #
2067	0	B	well, um, with credit cards is, me, i, uh, i try to get maybe just one or two,
2067	4	B	i don't, i don't like having credit cards for every store.
2067	4	B	i, i, uh, i just don't like them .
2067	20	A	what are you afraid of with them?
2067	13	B	what am i afraid of?
2067	19	A	yes.
2067	4	B	um, i don't know if i'm really afraid of spending too much.
2067	2	B	i just, uh, don't think that i need them, you know.
2067	5	B	i,
2067	2	B	uh, they are tempting at times,
2067	16	A	<Laughter>.
2067	4	B	but i, i just, you know, sometimes i just don't like everybody knowing everything about me, you know,
2067	5	B	so,
2067	3	A	well, that's very, can be very, very true.
2067	2	B	so, and th-, you know, everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money
2067	5	B	so,
2067	2	A	well, that's the idea.
2067	2	A	they figure that,
2067	6	B	yeah.
2067	7	A	if they give you card,
2067	6	B	uh-huh.
2067	7	A	at no charge for a whole year that you will use it
2067	5	A	and,
2067	3	B	that's right.
2067	2	B	see they make money off of it, whether you use it or not.
2067	3	A	absolutely.
2067	2	A	well, the other thing, of course, is the fact that they hope,
2067	16	B	<Child>.
2067	7	A	you will not pay your bill at the end of the month,
2067	3	B	# that's right. #
2067	7	A	# so that you # would be paying interest.
2067	6	B	uh-huh.
2067	4	A	i use mine a great deal, um, for groceries, for everything that i can and,
2067	6	B	uh-huh.
2067	7	A	then just write one check at the end of the month,
2067	4	B	# that's what i do. #
2067	7	A	# for the entire thing,
2067	5	A	# right.
2067	4	B	that's what i do.
2067	11	B	just a second.
2067	10	B	sorry .
2067	40	A	that's all right.
2067	29	A	sounds like you have a little one there.
2067	4	B	i have two little ones.
2067	3	B	yes.
2067	18	A	oh, you have.
2067	19	B	yeah.
2067	5	B	so tha-,
2067	9	A	great.
2067	20	A	how old are they?
2067	4	B	um, four and two and half.
2067	2	A	oh, boy. those are two very active ages .
2067	3	B	yes.
2067	3	B	so, yeah,
2067	2	B	um, i'm, i'm like you
2067	4	B	i, i use my, only use my credit card for, um, you know, when i, you know,
2067	4	B	i just use it whenever i feel like i don't want to write a check,
2067	4	B	and then, but i don't charge anything that i can't payoff at the end of the month.
2067	6	A	uh-huh.
2067	5	B	so,
2067	13	A	well, uh, do you, uh, do you ever use the a t m machines?
2067	26	B	no,
2067	4	B	i never do.
2067	4	B	my husband does at work just to get cash out,
2067	4	B	but, uh, i take the checkbook
2067	4	B	so i, you know, i, just, if i need cash, i just tell him
2067	4	B	and he gets it out
2067	4	B	and i don't even think i know my number .
2067	2	A	well, i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks,
2067	6	B	uh-huh.
2067	7	A	in order to get cash.
2067	3	B	that's right.
2067	4	B	see we, he couldn't do without it, h-, but, you know, since he can just do it right there at work,
2067	24	A	# oh, that helps. #
2067	7	B	# for nothing # .
2067	6	A	right.
2067	6	B	yeah.
2067	2	A	well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their a, their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash
2067	6	B	uh-huh.
2067	2	A	and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on.
2067	3	B	you're right.
2067	2	B	and that's kind of silly.
2067	3	A	yeah right.
2067	3	A	absolutely.
2067	6	B	yeah.
2067	2	A	because  they,
2067	2	B	you're defeating the purpose.
2067	7	A	they  figure that, that's correct .
2067	16	B	<Laughter>.
2067	2	A	the idea is to use their money .
2067	6	B	yeah.
2067	2	A	and, uh, during that whole month and,
2067	6	B	yeah.
2067	7	A	then pay it at the end of the month.
2067	3	B	yeah,
2067	4	B	i mean, i get, i get at least one or two a week.
2067	6	A	uh-huh.
2067	7	B	people, t-, you know, sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i don't want it.
2067	6	A	right.
2067	5	B	because i,
2067	2	A	well, i think that's the only thing you can do, is just say no and mean no and,
2067	3	B	# yeah.
2067	4	B	it's like, #
2067	7	A	# not be tempted. #
2067	7	B	i'd like to know where they determine that i'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say, you get this much credit line. you know.
2067	5	A	well, i-,
2067	33	B	you've already been preapproved.
2067	3	A	oh, absolutely,
2067	3	A	preapproved.
2067	2	A	that's their favorite word.
2067	3	B	yes.
2067	2	B	everybody in the country is preapproved, i think.
2067	3	A	i think so, you're right.
2067	5	B	so,
2067	2	A	well, it's interesting, uh, that, uh,
2067	6	B	yeah.
2067	7	A	people have the, generally the same view.
2067	6	B	uh-huh.
2067	7	A	of credit cards,
2067	6	B	yeah.
2067	7	A	no matter where you go.
2067	2	B	and, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, i didn't realize  i had this much,
2067	24	A	that much stuff.
2067	7	B	you know, i'd spent this much  money.
2067	6	A	right.
2067	2	B	and, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it.
2067	2	A	well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own,
2067	6	B	uh-huh.
2067	2	A	and, i mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem.
2067	3	B	yeah,
2067	2	B	it does because you're, you know, you, you're, you know, you're just co-, costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly, the minimum payment, you're paying interest,
2067	9	A	that's right.
2067	7	B	again
2067	5	B	so,
2067	9	A	that's right.
2067	6	B	yeah
2067	5	B	so,
2067	12	A	well it's been enjoyable talking with you.
2067	12	B	yeah.
2067	12	B	it's enjoyable talking with, seeing that somebody feels the same way,
2067	5	B	so, well,
2067	12	A	right.
2067	12	A	well take good care.
2067	12	A	take care of your little ones.
2067	12	B	you, you too.
2067	12	B	good luck.
2067	12	A	uh-huh.
2067	12	B	bye-bye.
2067	12	A	bye-bye.
2071	0	A	okay,
2071	20	A	ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy? .
2071	4	B	well, as a matter of fact, i was thinking about that the other day,
2071	4	B	and, uh, i really don't know the answer, ,
2071	4	B	uh, i would sort of like to, uh, think about something in the way of, uh, uh, sort of a sporty car but not any, not, you know, a luxury type sporty one.
2071	6	A	yeah.
2071	4	B	but, um, something that still has a lots of amenities and, you know, gadgets and things.
2071	13	A	oh, you do want a lot of that stuff?
2071	19	B	yeah,
2071	19	B	well, yeah
2071	4	B	i like, i like some of those things.
2071	4	B	they come in really handy .
2071	20	A	what kind of, uh, things are you going to consider,
2071	4	A	you know, what, uh, you said something about the, about the,
2071	22	A	well, what do you call them,
2071	4	A	you said amenities,
2071	30	B	amenities.
2071	7	A	that they have,
2071	20	A	but what about, um, their reputation of the company or the price.
2071	6	B	yeah,
2071	2	B	well, of course, i guess, uh, price is always the big consideration,
2071	5	B	but,
2071	4	A	it is for me,
2071	2	A	other people,
2071	6	B	yeah.
2071	7	A	don't seem to have the same problem .
2071	4	B	well, that's, that's a big one in my book,
2071	6	A	yeah.
2071	4	B	but, uh, um, i have preferences for, uh, for some, uh, makers over others, um,
2071	4	B	and i would sort of like to buy american,
2071	6	A	yeah.
2071	4	B	but, you know, i'm not so totally hung up on that, that  i wouldn't buy something else,
2071	1	B	how about you?
2071	4	A	well, um, the last car we bought was american because of, because of that reason,
2071	4	A	but have not been entirely happy with, uh, several things about the car,
2071	4	A	it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be.
2071	18	B	oh, really?
2071	4	A	because several things, minor things sort of,
2071	4	A	but still they cost us money, um, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that, that was that new,
2071	6	B	uh-huh.
2071	7	A	you know,
2071	4	A	we bought the car new
2071	5	A	and after,
2071	4	A	um, well, well, well under two years we had to replace the clutch.
2071	6	B	oh.
2071	4	A	and, they just said, well, you know, clutches are disposable ,
2071	4	A	and i said, since when?
2071	6	B	yeah.
2071	4	A	brake pads are disposable ,
2071	6	B	yeah.
2071	7	A	you know,
2071	4	A	we know that,
2071	4	A	but i never thought a clutch was disposable.
2071	3	B	yeah,
2071	4	B	i wouldn't have thought so either.
2071	3	A	yeah,
2071	4	A	so that was, that was kind of a shock .
2071	6	B	oh.
2071	6	B	yeah,
2071	2	B	i, i guess there's a lot to, to think about when you're trying to make that decision.
2071	3	A	yeah,
2071	2	A	you know, the less actually, the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars,
2071	4	A	they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like, like, uh, uh, a mercedes benz,
2071	4	A	they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable.
2071	6	B	right.
2071	2	A	you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a mercedes,
2071	3	B	no
2071	5	B	but then,
2071	7	A	especially not after two years.
2071	3	B	no,
2071	4	B	but on the other hand, i guess, too, uh, whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune.
2071	18	A	really?
2071	28	A	oh i don't know.
2071	6	B	yeah,
2071	4	B	i've, uh, worked with a couple of people who have owned, uh, various years, uh,
2071	6	A	uh-huh.
2071	7	B	mercedes
2071	4	B	and, even though they do a lot of the work themself then just buying the parts and everything is, is pretty expensive.
2071	4	B	but for them it's, it's sort of a hobby, too,
2071	6	A	yeah.
2071	7	B	to own them .
2071	20	A	what kind of,
2071	20	A	what brand of car are you thinking about buying
2071	20	A	or like what things are you looking at?
2071	4	B	well, i haven't re-, really gotten that far with it, um,
2071	4	B	i've always sort of liked general motors,
2071	6	A	uh-huh.
2071	7	B	a little bit better than some of the others
2071	28	B	but, uh, oh, i guess, i really don't know.
2071	5	A	how come
2071	4	A	i've been kind of, um,
2071	4	A	i guess the commercials are getting to me, the toyota commercials,
2071	6	B	yeah.
2071	4	A	and i know that a lot of people i've, i've known that have had toyotas have been just extremely happy with them, that hardly had any problems at all.
2071	6	B	yeah,
2071	5	B	that,
2071	5	B	i think that's,
2071	2	A	i think they have a really good, uh, quality.
2071	3	B	uh-huh.
2071	4	B	my, uh, daughter has owned two different ones,
2071	4	B	and, uh, you know, we've had some work done on them
2071	4	B	but it's not too bad,
2071	5	B	and the reason,
2071	4	B	one of the reasons we, um, bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years
2071	4	B	and he lived way out in the country
2071	4	B	so he put a lot of miles on it,
2071	6	A	uh-huh.
2071	4	B	and, you knew it had, had been through a whole lot,
2071	6	A	uh-huh.
2071	4	B	and yet, you know, it, it held up pretty doggone good,
2071	4	B	so,
2071	6	A	yeah.
2071	7	B	i thought they would ,
2071	2	A	they seem to be really durable.
2071	6	B	yeah.
2071	28	A	so, i don't know,
2071	4	A	i'm, i'm not ready to buy a new car yet,
2071	4	A	but i don't know, if, if the next time i'm going to try to, to stay with buying something american or if i'm going to go for a little more, what i would consider to be a long-term investment .
2071	6	B	yeah.
2071	5	B	well,
2071	2	B	and i guess, you know, you always have to think about things like, your gas mileage and stuff like that, you know,
2071	5	B	you ...
2071	4	A	oh, it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,
2071	6	B	yeah
2071	16	B	<<background noise>>.
2071	4	A	it gets excellent gas mileage.
2071	3	B	yeah,
2071	4	B	that's one of the big throwing cards for, some of the foreign ones .
2071	6	A	uh-huh.
2071	11	B	well, we talked long enough .
2071	3	A	i think so.
2071	6	B	okay,
2071	12	B	well, enjoyed it.
2071	12	A	all righty,
2071	38	A	thanks .

2072	4	A	uh, i'll just hand it off to you
2072	4	A	and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today.
2072	4	B	well, uh, the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time, are crafts
2072	4	B	and, uh, i've been involved in making, uh, hat stands and, uh, rag dolls and, uh, different type hats with, uh, flowers and roses, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing, straw hats and,
2072	6	A	oh .
2072	7	B	all that kind of stuff.
2072	4	B	and i enjoy it,
2072	2	B	it's relaxing.
2072	2	B	and you kind of get absorbed in it
2072	2	B	so the time goes by, you know, before you realize anything is going on.
2072	4	B	and i play the organ sometimes, uh, just for my own satisfaction . not for anybody else's ears
2072	4	B	because i'm not that good at it,
2072	4	B	but i like to bang on the keyboards once in a while.
2072	18	A	oh really?
2072	1	B	how about yourself?
2072	21	A	well, oh, hobbies, gee whiz,
2072	4	A	i guess i got too many hobbies
2072	4	A	so i never have time to deal with them.
2072	18	B	really?
2072	4	A	i like photography a lot,
2072	6	B	oh, yeah,

2072	4	A	i mainly play the guitar a lot,
2072	4	A	i play about every night.
2072	4	A	and, um, i really love that,
2072	2	A	if i had a druther ,
2072	2	A	if i could have, if i could make it on the road, i'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something,
2072	5	A	because that's,
2072	5	A	i've,
2072	9	B	oh, that sounds nice.
2072	4	B	i like bluegrass, too.

2072	4	A	i've done it before and when i was in hi-, in high school and college,
2072	6	B	uh-huh.
2072	7	A	and thoroughly enjoyed it,
2072	2	A	and it's really a, a blast.
2072	4	A	my wife hates it,
2072	2	A	but that's the way life is, i guess.
2072	29	B	that's the hard part, right?
2072	3	A	exactly.
2072	2	B	if you can do things together, that really helps a lot.
2072	6	A	yeah,
2072	5	A	we, uh,
2072	4	A	she's, uh, into aerobics,
2072	4	A	and,  uh,
2072	9	B	oh, that's good, too.
2072	7	A	and  we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
2072	4	A	and that went over real well,
2072	6	B	uh-huh.
2072	4	A	but, uh, that's about it there.
2072	9	B	oh, it's good
2072	2	B	and it's healthy, too.
2072	3	A	oh, yeah,
2072	3	A	yeah.
2072	4	B	we do that too,
2072	4	B	we have a, uh, a treadmill and, uh, a bicycle and that kind of stuff,

2072	9	A	oh, that's great.
2072	6	B	yeah.
2072	9	A	that's great.
2072	4	B	and we like movies,
2072	5	B	that ki-,
2072	5	B	yeah.
2072	6	A	yeah,
2072	5	A	that's, uh,
2072	5	A	spare time,
2072	2	A	with a child it's, kind of stra-,
2072	5	A	she's,
2072	5	A	we have, uh,
2072	4	A	we're looking for a baby-sitter
2072	4	A	so we've been out twice in o-, in this year so far.
2072	6	B	uh-huh.
2072	7	A	by ourselves without the child
2072	2	A	so it's kind of, uh, become an issue you could say.
2072	6	B	sure.
2072	5	A	um, hobbies,
2072	4	A	i like, messing around in your house building things, and, you know,
2072	3	B	oh yeah,
2072	9	B	that's great, too.
2072	7	A	putting cabinets up, and,
2072	6	B	uh-huh.
2072	7	A	those kind of things, um,
2072	6	B	yeah,
2072	4	B	we did some remodeling when we bought a house,
2072	4	B	we built, put a kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff, and painting and some wallpapering,
2072	2	B	that's fun.
2072	3	A	it's really kind of fun.
2072	3	B	it is.
2072	3	B	it really is.
2072	2	A	especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty,
2072	5	A	yeah.
2072	3	B	yeah,
2072	3	B	exactly.
2072	4	B	i like things that, you know, two people can do,
2072	4	B	but i like the quiet of doing things away, you know,
2072	2	B	kind of gives you some space for yourself,
2072	4	B	and that's what i find in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that i can create,
2072	4	B	and i like to crochet and knit.
2072	4	B	i made some afghans and that kind of stuff.
2072	4	B	i like doing things with my hands.
2072	6	A	uh-huh.
2072	9	A	sounds like it.
2072	3	B	yeah.

2072	5	A	so, i,
2072	5	A	it,
2072	16	B	<Laughter>.
2072	5	A	so when it comes to,
2072	4	A	i like to cook and eat and,
2072	6	B	yeah.
2072	7	A	to have, mai-, mainly, i guess, i get to
2072	4	A	amount of people eat, *listen
2072	6	B	uh-huh.
2072	7	A	and then say, man this is really good,
2072	3	B	yeah,
2072	2	B	it is.
2072	5	A	um, um, but it just,
2072	4	A	work in the garden, work around the yard, of course,
2072	13	B	do you do barbecues?

2072	6	A	oh, sure,
2072	6	A	yeah.
2072	7	B	and, uh, worked in the abilene plant,
2072	4	B	and we used to go to joe allen's barbecue,
2072	2	B	and, uh, oh, that was great.
2072	6	A	oh, yeah.
2072	2	B	really great,
2072	2	A	that's, uh,
2072	2	B	they have some nice stuff down there.
2072	7	A	only way to do it.
2072	4	B	i miss it .
2072	6	A	well, yeah,
2072	5	A	it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh,
2072	2	A	there's, uh, there's pluses to everything,
2072	6	B	oh, yeah.
2072	2	A	but, you know, seems like there's just so many things to do down here,
2072	4	A	i like the sports,
2072	4	A	i play a lot of racquetball.
2072	4	B	we did, i did horseback riding, too,
2072	4	B	in fact, when my children were growing up, we always had horses
2072	4	B	and, uh, that was kind of for them,
2072	4	B	but they weren't as interested in it as we were, you know,
2072	4	B	so, uh, that was a real,
2072	4	B	i'd say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know,
2072	4	B	we always had horses around,
2072	4	B	and i really enjoyed that,
2072	9	A	oh, that's great,
2072	2	A	sounds like you,
2072	4	B	and i was disappointed when i went to texas.
2072	4	B	i didn't see that many of them.
2072	32	A	horses?
2072	3	B	yes .
2072	3	A	yeah,
2072	2	A	you really don't.
2072	5	A	yeah,
2072	5	A	th-, the,
2072	2	A	you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete, uh,
2072	3	B	i know,
2072	3	B	i know,
2072	3	B	it's true.
2072	2	A	there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people
2072	2	A	and that's about it down here,
2072	5	A	and so,
2072	6	B	uh-huh.
2072	6	A	yeah.
2072	9	A	but, uh, that's great.
2072	2	A	well, sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there.
2072	6	B	yeah,

2160	6	A	yeah,
2160	5	A	so . *need slash
2160	4	B	well, my name's mary.
2160	7	A	my name is fernando. / *sd
2160	0	B	fernando, glad to know you.
2160	5	A	so, um, do you, well,
2160	20	A	how'd you find out about this?
2160	4	B	uh, i was visiting my son down in dallas,
2160	5	B	and.
2160	14	A	oh, okay,
2160	29	A	he works for t i.
2160	26	B	no,
2160	26	B	no,
2160	4	B	but his wife has a contract with t i,
2160	4	B	and that's how we learned about it,
2160	5	B	uh-huh.
2160	14	A	oh, okay,
2160	4	A	because i'm down at n c state.
2160	6	B	yeah,
2160	6	B	uh-huh.
2160	4	A	and so i took a class,
2160	4	A	and he said, sign up and get some money
2160	9	B	right .
2160	7	A	and just talk for five minutes.
2160	13	A	so are you ready?
2160	23	B	i'm ready.
2160	5	A	okay,
2160	11	A	let's get started.
2160	3	B	all right,
2160	3	B	okay.
2160	5	A	okay,
2160	1	A	so, uh, what do you think, that, uh,
2160	1	A	what do, what do, what do you think we can do to solve the crime in america?
2160	2	B	oh, if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person.
2160	6	A	yeah,
2160	1	A	but what, what, what are the steps?
2160	2	B	well, you have to see,
2160	0	B	i, the way i look at it, you have to think first of all why, / *listen
2160	8	B	or ha-, has  crime increased,
2160	8	B	and if so, why has crime increased?
2160	2	A	well, see the problem is, is that, um, what happens is as, that you're, uh, you know, as you go from the country to a city, crime always increases, right?
2160	6	B	uh-huh.
2160	2	A	because in the country, people still respect, uh, the property of other people.
2160	6	B	right.
2160	5	A	and so, as, as,
2160	2	A	and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city.
2160	6	B	uh-huh.
2160	2	A	now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities,
2160	2	A	and they rush to get the same thing.
2160	2	A	they say, why can't we have the same things that these other people have,
2160	2	A	and the thing that we can do is, we need money for drugs,
2160	2	A	and what we have to do is, we have to go, uh, get some stuff, steal it, and then, you know, just resell it.
2160	29	B	it's easy,
2160	2	B	you said the magic word there.
2160	20	A	# which one? #
2160	4	B	# drugs. #
2160	6	A	yeah.
2160	2	B	and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased.
2160	2	A	that's, uh, that's, uh, the main reason i think, uh, everywhere
2160	2	A	because, uh, you have deaths.
2160	2	A	i mean, i mean, you have murders
2160	2	A	and you have, you know, people stealing other people's stuff,
2160	5	A	and that's
2160	2	A	a lot of it has to do with drugs.
2160	3	B	oh, yes.
2160	5	A	it doesn't have to do,
2160	2	A	i mean, the thing is is that, you know, it's like you might be standing somewhere, right,
2160	2	A	and like let's say you, you're, you're, you know, you're driving out
2160	2	A	and you're driving back home
2160	2	A	and it's late at night.
2160	2	A	and you stop by one of these, you know, twenty-four hour, you know, gas stations joints.
2160	6	B	yeah.
2160	2	A	and, uh, somebody walks in there with a gun.
2160	2	A	i mean, they're going to want the money,
2160	2	A	and you can tell by the people who are always caught, that these people are there to get money for drugs.
2160	2	A	i mean, they don't want the money so, uh, so they can do something else with it.
2160	3	B	no,
2160	2	B	they don't want the money for food,
2160	2	B	that's for sure.
2160	3	A	right,
2160	3	A	right, #
2160	5	A	and so. #
2160	2	B	# well, but you know, the, # the strange thing, uh, perhaps, not strange, but something that many people don't realize, is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids,
2160	4	B	because, uh, i'm a retired educator.
2160	14	A	okay .
2160	4	B	and, in fifty-one and fifty-two, the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs, how to recognize the pushers
2160	6	A	yeah.
2160	7	B	outside the one entrance, that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started, and so on, and so on.
2160	2	B	so it's a problem that's been around for over forty years,
2160	2	B	and we're just really, uh, uh, now, trying to, uh, figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge.
2160	6	A	yeah,
2160	4	A	there's a, there's  a, uh, a  song that i know which says, you know, tha-,
2160	4	A	it's like, in, uh, nineteen eighty-eight, nineteen eighty-nine, the local, state, and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in america,
2160	2	A	and, uh, their figures, i think are too, so
2160	2	A	i mean it's like, compared to, you know, compared to, weapons or stuff like that, i mean, you're spending nothing on, on crime in the country itself.
2160	5	A	what you're doing is, you, you know,
2160	2	A	it's like, you have other things, you know,
2160	2	A	you have the aids
2160	2	A	we're going to solve, try to solve
2160	6	B	uh-huh.
2160	7	A	the aids problem while, while, you know, some people are getting killed here and there
2160	5	A	and then .
2160	6	B	yeah
2160	2	B	and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers, the big dealers in drugs,
2160	6	A	uh-huh.
2160	7	B	may be, may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction.
2160	2	A	but those people never get caught.
2160	5	A	the people   that --
2160	3	B	that's right,
2160	2	B	they'll never get caught.
2160	7	A	that,   that  i,
2160	2	A	see, their theory is that if i'm surrounded, and i'm going to be caught, i'm going to try to find my way through,
2160	2	A	and they're not going to take me alive.
2160	6	B	uh-huh.
2160	2	A	but i have such a big army outside of my place, that nobody can touch me.
2160	3	B	that's right.
2160	5	B	but they'll,
2160	2	A	you know, it's like,
2160	2	A	of course, i mean i might be, you know, the the leading drug dealer here,
2160	2	A	but you won't find me dealing in drugs,
2160	2	A	i mean, there's no connection
2160	3	B	that's right.
2160	7	A	between me and the people that were caught, you know.
2160	3	B	that's right,
2160	5	B	and, they,
2160	2	B	one person doesn't know the other person down the line.
2160	3	A	right.
2160	2	B	but the guy at the very top, the one who's, who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure, uh, the, uh, and had the political
2160	6	A	yeah.
2160	7	B	uh, pull to keep things from, uh, keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction, other than on the drug dealing,
2160	2	B	because it sure is monstrous in this country.
2160	6	A	yeah,
2160	4	A	i was, i was at a, at a party on saturday,
2160	4	A	and this guy comes over,
2160	4	A	he goes, hey, how you doing,
2160	4	A	he started talking to me,
2160	4	A	and this guy was from jamaica, right.
2160	6	B	uh-huh.
2160	4	A	and he's got his little brother selling drugs .
2160	6	B	uh-huh.
2160	4	A	you know, and he goes, yeah, i just came up here to work,
2160	4	A	and i go, oh you did, you make very good money up here.
2160	4	A	he goes, yeah, i make a lot, a lot of money,
2160	5	A	he goes, you know.
2160	5	A	and, uh, in the movie good fellows.
2160	3	B	yeah,
2160	3	B	might. / *spelling??
2160	13	A	did you see it?
2160	26	B	nope,
2160	4	B	i only heard about it.
2160	14	A	okay,
2160	4	A	in one part, the guy goes out of jail,
2160	4	A	and within, uh, two months, he has all his house payments gone
2160	6	B	uh-huh.
2160	7	A	everything paid, you know,
2160	4	A	and he had enough money to, you know,
2160	4	A	it's like, those guys, at one point, you know, they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it .
2160	6	B	yeah,
2160	5	B	really, you know,
2160	2	B	even in our prison systems they're finding that they're, they're having drugs smuggled into them.
2160	6	A	yeah,
2160	6	A	yeah,
2160	4	A	that's,  that, that was  also in the movie.
2160	6	B	right.
2160	6	A	yeah.
2160	25	A	so hello mary.

2160	12	B	i appreciate the call.
2160	12	B	# i enjoyed talking with you. #
2160	12	A	# all right, # okay,
2160	12	A	same here.
2160	12	B	uh-huh,
2160	12	B	# bye-bye. #
2160	12	A	# bye-bye. #
2163	0	A	okay.
2163	0	B	okay.
2163	4	A	i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute.
2163	6	B	okay.
2163	2	A	well, credit cards, boy, that's an easy topic,
2163	3	B	ye-,
2163	13	A	isn't it .
2163	7	B	yes,
2163	2	B	it is .
2163	2	B	it's one we all hold dear and near, i'm sure.
2163	3	A	oh, yes,
2163	3	A	yes.
2163	4	A	i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them.
2163	6	B	yeah,
2163	4	B	most of mine's been pretty good, although i'm, i guess i'm like a lot of other people, now,
2163	4	B	i'm trying to, to pay off my credit cards
2163	4	B	and, and, uh, i've done pretty good at it.
2163	5	B	yeah.
2163	6	A	uh-huh .
2163	4	A	well, i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want .
2163	16	B	<Laughter>.
2163	7	A	you know
2163	6	B	yeah.
2163	7	A	not need, want.
2163	6	B	uh-huh,
2163	2	B	there is a big difference .
2163	2	A	there's a big difference there.
2163	6	B	yeah,
2163	6	B	yeah.
2163	4	A	but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline.
2163	6	B	yeah,
2163	6	B	oh yeah,
2163	4	B	i, i do that,
2163	4	B	i do that,
2163	4	B	but the rest, like i said, the rest of them i've been trying to, to pay off
2163	6	A	uh-huh.
2163	7	B	and, uh, get back on a cash basis, except for gas.
2163	4	B	it's too easy to, to run into the gas station.
2163	4	A	oh, it sure is
2163	5	B	and, .
2163	7	A	especially when you work out of town and everything, that way .
2163	6	B	uh-huh.
2163	4	A	at least that's for me.
2163	6	B	yeah,
2163	6	B	yeah.
2163	6	A	yeah.
2163	5	B	so.
2163	6	A	but yeah,
2163	4	A	i've, i've talked to some who's really had some bad experience
2163	4	A	and kind of knock on wood i haven't yet, not bad.
2163	6	B	yeah,
2163	5	B	well that's,
2163	4	A	you know, i just, i'm just shocked at the end of the month,
2163	16	B	<Laughter>.
2163	7	A	to see what damage i have did,
2163	4	A	but ,
2163	6	B	yeah,
2163	6	B	yeah.
2163	7	A	i try to keep it pretty reasonable.
2163	4	B	well, i've been pretty lucky in that respect.
2163	4	B	i don't charge, like i say, i've,  i been trying to, to not charge  except for emergencies.
2163	6	A	uh-huh.
2163	4	B	and, uh, so, but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards.
2163	5	B	there's, you know,
2163	2	B	they have, uh, wonderful features,
2163	2	B	they're there when you need them.
2163	6	A	yeah,
2163	6	A	yeah.
2163	7	B	you know, like in emergencies, or whatever.
2163	2	A	and then they have bad drawbacks, too.
2163	3	B	yeah.
2163	2	B	it's, # it's awfully easy. #
2163	7	A	# i mean high interest, #
2163	4	A	it's like paying twice.
2163	9	B	that's true,
2163	9	B	that's true,
2163	6	A	yes,
2163	5	A	so, .
2163	5	B	i try to,
2163	4	B	i did switch to one, uh, sponsored by the credit union, though. that seems to be a pretty low interest.
2163	6	A	oh, uh-huh.
2163	7	B	yeah, compared to some of the other ones.
2163	6	A	yeah,
2163	6	A	yeah.
2163	4	B	and you don't have an annual fee there,
2163	4	B	and that helps.
2163	3	A	oh, yes.
2163	4	A	uh, we used to have, you know, like several,
2163	4	A	but right now, we're just more or less at american express,
2163	6	B	uh-huh.
2163	7	A	you know,
2163	4	A	and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in.
2163	6	B	yeah,
2163	4	B	that's one way to do it, because that, that forces you to pay for it
2163	6	A	yeah.
2163	7	B	instead of saying, well, i'll just
2163	24	A	pay fifteen,
2163	6	A	yeah.
2163	7	B	pay on it this month
2163	5	B	and ,
2163	3	A	yes,
2163	4	A	i know,
2163	6	A	yeah.
2163	6	B	yeah.
2163	2	A	and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time.
2163	30	B	takes a long time,
2163	9	B	that's right.
2163	9	A	it sure does.
2163	2	B	and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off, off your income tax
2163	6	A	uh-huh.
2163	7	B	that's, you know.
2163	4	B	of course it's been going down for a number of years,
2163	4	B	but this is the last year you can take anything.
2163	5	B	so.
2163	6	A	uh-huh,
2163	6	A	yeah.
2163	5	B	so.
2163	12	A	well, i've enjoyed talking to you.
2163	12	B	well, i've enjoyed talking to you.
2163	12	A	and maybe we'll get to talk again.
2163	12	B	okay.
2163	12	A	okay,
2163	12	A	bye-bye.
2163	12	B	bye-bye.
2175	0	A	okay.
2175	30	B	okay.
2175	16	A	<Laughter>.
2175	4	B	i forgot all about that that it had to be pressed.
2175	16	A	<Laughter>.
2175	5	B	um, but anyway, so, so as far as,
2175	4	B	w-, we really, we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of t v
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	7	B	because we both were raised, you know, that way, you know, where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a t v to be the baby-sitter.
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	4	B	and we just don't want that.
2175	4	B	we want more communication and interaction, you know, amongst us as a family.
2175	4	B	and we both like sports,
2175	4	B	so we figured, well what, what better way to get out and, you know, be together as a family
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	7	B	and also, you know, have it be good for you.
2175	4	B	and plus, we like, we both like to cook,
2175	4	B	so, you know, that's something we spend time together too, is, you know, cooking and, uh, preparing meals and stuff.
2175	4	B	so, uh, but as far as that , that's about all we've discussed # as far as for family. #
2175	6	A	# really,
2175	6	A	okay,
2175	4	A	well see, # i'm the third oldest of twelve children.
2175	16	A	.
2175	9	B	oh my gosh.
2175	5	A	so like i said, i,
2175	4	A	and i'm only twenty-one.
2175	4	A	i'll be twenty-two next month.
2175	4	A	so there's nine that are younger than me.
2175	4	A	my youngest sister is five.
2175	6	B	oh yeah.
2175	4	A	and like i sa-, i don't have any children.
2175	4	A	i'm just engaged,
2175	4	A	and i'm getting married in october,
2175	4	A	and we haven't discussed this at all . um.
2175	6	B	yeah,
2175	13	B	long way down the road, right.
2175	19	A	yeah,
2175	4	A	exactly.
2175	4	A	but, um, now i've noticed that like, while i'm at college, and when i go home, my bro-, you know, my,
2175	4	A	i'm really close to the younger ones,
2175	4	A	and, um, like, when, when, like when i do go home they enjoy just laying around me, you know,
2175	4	A	like if we do watch t v at night, they just like enjoy just, like laying on top of me or something.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	4	A	they like that.
2175	16	B	<Laughter>.
2175	4	A	but, um, as far as that goes, like we play games,
2175	4	A	i play like old maid and fish with them,
2175	4	A	and w-, we play board games,
2175	5	A	and when it's ni-,
2175	4	A	like i'm from pennsylvania,
2175	4	A	so when it's nice out, we go outside,
2175	4	A	and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff.
2175	5	A	so.
2175	6	B	uh-huh.
2175	7	A	we do a lot of that.
2175	4	A	and in the summer everyone is like, i think there's like seven of us still at home,
2175	4	A	and all seven are in a sport,
2175	4	A	like also the girls are in softball
2175	4	A	and the boys are in baseball.
2175	4	A	so all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports,
2175	4	A	that's it, you know.
2175	5	B	well do you, do you,
2175	13	B	so you go,  if you're, if you're not doing any kind of sport thing you go  to one of your sisters' or brothers'
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	7	B	sporting events.
2175	19	A	yes.
2175	7	B	and sort of like be there with them.
2175	23	A	right,
2175	19	A	yeah,
2175	4	A	we go and watch.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	2	B	well, that's, that's good, too, i mean, as far as entering,
2175	2	B	i mean, you're, you're participating,
2175	2	B	but you're not, you know.
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	2	B	i mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff
2175	5	B	and that's,
2175	6	A	yeah.
2175	4	B	because, um, even if our kids, you know, get into sports that we're really not interested in, i don't, i want them, you know, to know that we're still there
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	7	B	so to speak, as a family.
2175	4	A	well, it's funny because, um, well, my mom and dad both were kind of athletic.
2175	4	A	they both grew up on a farm,
2175	4	A	but although, you know, it wasn't them playing i notice like whenever i was playing softball and such, my mom and dad got into it more than i did.
2175	4	A	i mean, they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling, # you know,
2175	5	A	so. #
2175	6	B	# yeah.
2175	29	B	cheering you on and stuff. #
2175	2	A	a lot of times the parents get into it just as much as, as the kids,
2175	4	A	and i found, like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff, it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu-, you know, get into fights, who can scream louder, and you know, everything.
2175	4	A	so it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it,
2175	4	A	and they're not really even participating.
2175	6	B	yeah,
2175	2	B	well, that, that would be fun.
2175	29	B	boy, so you, you have a lot of experience as far as, you know, different ways a family can interact and, and do things together,
2175	3	A	yeah.
2175	7	B	as far as,
2175	5	B	go-,
2175	5	B	twelve.
2175	3	A	uh-huh.
2175	5	B	but it's
2175	5	B	so, if you're not,
2175	5	B	i-,
2175	5	B	what if,
2175	13	B	do people go off in their own little groups with that many?
2175	13	B	i mean, did like some people go to their rooms and ,
2175	19	A	yeah,
2175	5	A	it's, um,
2175	4	A	the, the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real-, we really don't have any privacy when we're at home, because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	4	A	but, um, like i say, you know, i'm twenty, i'll be twenty-two next month,
2175	4	A	and i'm closer to the younger kids than i am the ones my own age.
2175	4	A	and  that's,  i think,
2175	6	B	huh.
2175	7	A	that's  because we-, the ones that are older all have their own little thing to do,
2175	4	A	and the younger kids are at home,
2175	4	A	and i like to spend time with them.
2175	5	A	so.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	7	A	i don't, i don't, you know,
2175	20	B	but when you were growing up and they weren't, and the younger ones weren't around, what did you do?
2175	39	A	we were all pretty close when we were younger.
2175	14	B	oh, i see.
2175	13	B	but now that they've all sort of moved off,
2175	19	A	yeah,
2175	4	A	now that we're getting older, people are get-, you know, each one of us are going our own direction.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	5	B	so, do you think, even,
2175	20	B	i mean, what did you do when you were younger,
2175	13	B	did you go do the board games and stuff,
2175	13	B	you still did what you do now.
2175	19	A	oh, yeah.
2175	4	A	and, um, we, you know, we had blocks and stuff,
2175	4	A	and we just did, we would make,
2175	4	A	like in the winter when it wa-,
2175	4	A	we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff
2175	6	B	uh-huh.
2175	4	A	we, uh, we would, um, clear out our basement,
2175	4	A	and we would like, do, just, even stupid things,
2175	4	A	like we try hurtling our couches and stuff. you know, and.
2175	13	B	hurling.
2175	19	A	yeah,
2175	4	A	we would just run and jump over the couches.
2175	14	B	oh, hurtle,
2175	14	B	oh, okay.
2175	6	A	yeah,
2175	4	A	to see who could jump over, you know.
2175	4	A	we just made up our own stupid little games.
2175	4	A	and like hide and seek,
2175	4	A	well, we have a, a bigger house than a lot, you know,
2175	4	A	our house isn't the average small one.
2175	4	A	so we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that.
2175	29	B	so you, you had a lot of games and things you played
2175	3	A	yeah.
2175	7	B	even when you were kids with the ones that you,
2175	4	A	well see, they're, um,  we're all, like we're all  pretty close together.
2175	4	A	like, m-, my sister that's closest to me, we're only fourteen months apart.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	4	A	so there was always, there was never just one alone, you know.
2175	6	B	yeah,
2175	29	B	no, not real spread in age.
2175	3	A	right.
2175	4	A	so we were all pretty close where we, we always had a buddy to play with,
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	7	A	you know.
2175	9	B	gosh, twelve,
2175	13	B	is that, is that pretty common up there, uh, in,
2175	26	A	no,
2175	26	A	no,
2175	4	A	not at all.
2175	14	B	oh, okay.
2175	4	A	not at all .
2175	4	B	i don't meet, i mean, i don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more.
2175	4	B	i mean
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	7	B	my, my husband's mother came from a family of thirteen,
2175	4	B	but, i mean, that's his mother
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	7	B	you know,
2175	2	B	and, and their catholic / *they're
2175	5	B	and, i mean that's,
2175	6	A	well, yeah,
2175	4	A	i'm catholic .
2175	2	B	well that's it then, i think,
2175	2	B	probably maybe that, that.
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	13	B	but, i mean, do you see yourself having thirteen kids
2175	26	A	no,
2175	4	A	not at all.
2175	7	B	or twelve kids?
2175	4	A	not at all.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	4	A	but, see, um, when i was younger i used to say that i would like to have five.
2175	4	A	well, i've even cut that down now,
2175	4	A	and, um, but to me five wasn't even a lot, because i was just so used to twelve.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	6	A	you know.
2175	2	B	but it's so expensive, man.
2175	3	A	but, yeah,
2175	2	A	it's so, it would be really hard now to have twelve children.
2175	2	B	i would think for your parents it would be, it would still be hard even nowadays, i mean, just to raise twelve kids.
2175	4	A	well,
2175	2	B	would be, shoosh.
2175	7	A	well,   okay, well  like my oldest brother, he's, he's twenty-four,
2175	4	A	and he put himself through college,
2175	4	A	and, um, there's a sister older than me,
2175	4	A	she's still living at home,
2175	4	A	but she works
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	7	A	you know,
2175	4	A	and i think she even gives mom and dad a little bit, you know, of rent money.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	4	A	and i'm putting myself through college,
2175	4	A	and like i'm getting married in october,
2175	4	A	and my fianc3e and i are paying for most of the wedding.
2175	4	A	and then, then my brother right behind me, he moved out,
2175	4	A	and he has an apartment,
2175	4	A	and he works,
2175	4	A	and then the next one down is in the marines,
2175	4	A	and he's out of the house.
2175	4	A	so, it's kind of like they don't, you know.
2175	2	B	well sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though, you know.
2175	2	B	i mean
2175	3	A	i, i think they do.
2175	7	B	you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	2	B	so you, you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself,
2175	3	A	exactly.
2175	7	B	if you really want it.
2175	4	A	like, uh, well, i find it a lot when i'm up here at college because i've always had a bank account,
2175	4	A	i've always had my own checking account since i was in like tenth grade.
2175	6	B	uh-huh.
2175	4	A	you know, i would work in the summer,
2175	4	A	and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or, you know,
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	7	A	to, to manage money.
2175	4	A	like my roommate's laughing at, you know, at me, you know, # because their schooling's paid for. #
2175	5	B	# or manage money or know,
2175	5	B	# yeah,
2175	8	B	know, you know, how to get, how to even go about getting money.
2175	3	A	yeah,
2175	3	A	uh-huh.
2175	8	B	you know, how to get a job or you know, just what, you know, what, when you get a job, what your responsibility is.
2175	6	A	yeah.
2175	8	B	are you going to blow all that money,
2175	2	B	how easy it is to blow money you earn.
2175	3	A	yeah.
2175	4	A	and see, and then, my mom and dad, like whenever, like we would go out and we would get a summer job,
2175	4	A	and then we would start blowing money,
2175	4	A	and my mom said, well that's stupid for you to be blowing money.
2175	4	A	she goes, okay if your going to blow your money on other things, she goes, you can just pay for your life insurance.
2175	4	A	so then we, when we all graduated from hi-, college, from high school,
2175	6	B	uh-huh.
2175	7	A	we all got,
2175	4	A	we're still, like i'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because i'm still in school,
2175	4	A	but i have my own policy, too.
2175	5	A	so i had a poli-,
2175	4	A	you know, my mom and dad got it set up, you know, you know, helped me to get it and everything,
2175	4	A	and i have my own policy,
2175	4	A	and then i pay for my own life insurance too.
2175	2	B	wow,
2175	4	A	and then --
2175	7	B	you've really got responsibilities.
2175	7	A	and then,  like, my mom and dad, because there's so many of us, and because of the way the laws are, you know, now, if we want to drive, we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	4	A	because my mom said, that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it,
2175	2	A	if we were in a wreck, you know, you can be sued for anything now.
2175	4	A	and she said that's really not fair to the younger kids.
2175	2	A	if we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued
2175	2	A	and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad,
2175	2	A	and the little kids would have nothing.
2175	3	A	and i, i agree with her.
2175	28	A	you know, i just, i don't know.
2175	6	B	yeah.
2175	5	B	wh-,
2175	4	A	so if, you know, if we want to drive, we pay our own insurance,
2175	5	A	and.
2175	2	B	so really, i think, sometimes there's an advantage,
2175	2	B	i mean, sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent.
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	2	B	it makes you know that you can't take anything for granted
2175	6	A	yeah.
2175	7	B	that when you get something you're lucky to get it, so to speak
2175	6	A	uh-huh.
2175	7	B	you know.
2175	28	B	so, um, i don't know,
2175	5	B	sometimes,
2175	2	B	but now, it, it is hard, i can imagine, on your parents, you know ...
2253	0	A	yeah,
2253	20	A	the question was, uh, what kind of books do you read for entertainment, uh, uh, i guess,
2253	4	B	oh, i just read for escape.
2253	14	A	okay .
2253	5	B	well, i mean it's,
2253	9	A	with two little kids i can understand that.
2253	6	B	yes.
2253	2	B	it's that's simple.
2253	4	B	i read to escape,
2253	4	B	and i don't read any parents magazines either.
2253	6	A	oh .
2253	5	B	so.
2253	20	A	what, uh, what kind of,
2253	4	B	well, i just finished,  just, i just finished  one last night. a great book.
2253	4	B	it, it's very, a typical for my reading though but a great book, one called, the things they carried by tim o'brien.
2253	6	A	huh.
2253	5	B	and it's, uh,
2253	9	B	god
2253	4	B	i don't know if i would call it a collection of vietnam war stories or if i'd call it a collection of vietnam love stories.
2253	6	A	oh.
2253	4	B	strange book. beautifully written.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	4	B	just beautifully written.
2253	13	A	by, uh, somebody who was there
2253	5	A	or,
2253	19	B	yeah,
2253	4	B	a guy who was there as a, uh, foot soldier.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	4	B	so, he considered himself to be, you know, a, a true vietnam soldier.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	5	A	well, any of the guys that were ground
2253	5	A	yes.
2253	5	A	yeah,
2253	9	A	i can imagine.
2253	6	B	yeah.
2253	20	B	so, what's the latest one you've read?
2253	21	A	well, i tell you what,
2253	21	A	i'm a kind of, uh, a history nut.
2253	21	A	i'm trying to think back now,
2253	4	A	i read an awful lot of, uh, periodicals and, uh, you know, almost what you call reference books.
2253	6	B	uh-huh.
2253	4	A	and, uh, the last, uh, i'm embarrassed to say the last, you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that i read, i cannot, right offhand, i tried to read, uh, one of the, the michener, uh, lone star or the, the texas history book.
2253	4	B	i have never been able to make it through any of michener's work.
2253	4	A	oh, well, i've had similar problems.
2253	2	A	it does tend to, to,
2253	13	B	have you, are you a civil war buff at all?
2253	19	A	yeah, as a matter of fact,
2253	19	A	yeah .
2253	4	B	because i finished one,
2253	4	B	i think this is like two years ago,
2253	4	B	and somebody had given me one of these dinky do, crappy women's novels set in the civil war, john jakes with ,
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	B	and the novel didn't do that much for me.
2253	2	B	but, boy, the period of time was fascinating.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	4	B	so, i then read, was it battle cry of freedom,
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	5	B	or,
2253	5	B	yeah,
2253	4	B	i think it was battle cry of freedom.
2253	30	A	battle cry of freedom .
2253	4	B	it's kind of like a historical compendium,
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	7	B	of the civil war,
2253	4	B	and it's not a story of the civil war,
2253	4	B	it's a story of all the politics and, uh, lobbying and just basically state by state events,
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	7	B	that lead to the events that brought about the civil war.
2253	4	B	and it's fascinating because i had always, you know, been raised on this, you know, emancipation proclamation with the civil war.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	13	A	there was a lot more to it than that, weren't there?
2253	23	B	there was a lot more to it than that.
2253	4	B	as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought.
2253	6	A	yeah,
2253	2	A	well, it was a political move.
2253	6	B	oh, yeah.
2253	2	A	it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the united states.
2253	2	A	all the other areas which would, i think at that time would have included west virginia and, oh, may have been kentucky, a few states, you know, that were not part of the south but still had slaves.
2253	6	B	uh-huh.
2253	2	A	they didn't emancipate them.
2253	8	B	well, you know what else really surprised me, now
2253	4	B	i'm married to a native texan
2253	4	B	and i'm not.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	6	B	uh,
2253	4	A	i've got the same problem .
2253	6	B	yeah,
2253	4	B	i'm glad you put it that way.
2253	16	A	<Laughter>.
2253	4	B	and i have two native texan children too.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	B	my husband is always, you know, talked about th-, texas being a, uh, rebel state.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	4	B	and, oh, my god, all this civil war pride.
2253	5	B	i kept waiting for,
2253	8	B	where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the civil war.
2253	5	A	mayb-,
2253	13	A	isn't much there, was there?
2253	2	B	they might as well have not even been there.
2253	6	A	right.
2253	2	B	you know, they weren't a state
2253	2	B	and the only, the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to, you know, who's going to be going there.
2253	4	B	and i keep telling my husband that,
2253	4	B	and he keeps saying, oh, no.
2253	4	B	i thought, okay.
2253	5	A	they supplied some, uh, you know,
2253	4	A	they were some groups of it, the vicksburg,
2253	4	A	if you ever get a chance to go over to vicksburg, the battleground at vicksburg, uh, there's an area there where there was, uh, some texas, uh, groups
2253	2	A	and they had an interesting time there.
2253	3	B	oh, i'll bet they did.
2253	4	A	and down there at sabine pass, uh, i can't think of the guy's name
2253	2	A	but he held off, uh, you know, just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole union navy for a while from coming up the sabine river which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story.
2253	8	B	well, you know, why they actually held them off?
2253	2	B	none of the yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar .
2253	17	A	that could be it , could be it.
2253	11	B	now, you didn't hear me say that.
2253	5	B	outside of, uh,
2253	4	A	and then the last civil war battle was fought at val verde, you know,
2253	4	A	over there on the texas border you had a lot of, of groups heading for mexico
2253	4	A	and they were cut off at the pass more or less, at eagle pass.
2253	4	A	and they didn't get across the river there
2253	5	A	so they're, the last,
2253	4	A	and that was actually after the war was over
2253	4	A	but it was the last,
2253	6	B	yeah.
2253	7	A	organized battle between the two units was in texas,
2253	5	A	so.
2253	6	B	oh.
2253	6	A	yeah,
2253	2	A	texas participation in the civil war was, uh, minor at, uh,
2253	5	A	it's been,
2253	9	B	boy,
2253	11	B	don't tell that to a native texan though,
2253	3	A	yeah.
2253	2	B	i mean, my god, they fought and won the whole thing.
2253	6	A	yeah,
2253	4	A	well, my wife's from galveston,
2253	5	A	so.
2253	6	B	oh.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	A	well, i'm from new mexico
2253	5	A	so, you know, i was ,
2253	9	B	that's a beautiful state.
2253	9	B	that's a beautiful state.
2253	2	B	see i was raised in the midwest which,
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	7	B	you know, hell, we didn't even, you know, we didn't even know where the mason dixon line was,
2253	2	B	and besides, you know, if corn didn't grow there,
2253	6	A	huh.
2253	7	B	it didn't matter.
2253	2	A	it sounds like iowa or something.
2253	4	B	iowa and nebraska.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	6	B	yep.
2253	4	B	and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in massachusetts
2253	8	B	so, you know.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	7	B	what does that make me, an honorary yankee
2253	8	B	or,
2253	6	A	yeah,
2253	5	A	on,
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	7	B	god knows what.
2253	4	A	oh, well, my sister's living in illinois right now,
2253	5	A	so .
2253	2	B	well then, she's going to come out well rounded.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	B	but outside of those kind of things, you know, the other thing that i've really gotten into reading,
2253	4	B	and i think this is because the kids are getting to me,
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	7	B	is science fiction.
2253	4	A	i've always kind of enjoyed it.
2253	4	A	i, i used to read a lot more than i do now.
2253	4	B	well, i've gone to the point where my husband, my husband travels, i get out like, you know, two or three books.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	4	B	and i, i'm trying to think of, oh, isaac asimov, robot series.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	B	i mean, i think i've read all four of them
2253	4	B	and i understand that there's a fifth.
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	4	B	in the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot.
2253	4	A	i just turned around and looked at my brief, at  my briefcase, my, uh, bookcase  up here
2253	4	A	and i see armageddon up there.
2253	4	A	and, uh, the shadow of blooming grove and two thousand and ten and grant takes command and the war in the year , oh, space that was the one i was trying to wade through was space, james michener. didn't get very far on that.
2253	4	B	you know, i think i read hawaii,
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	7	B	when i was about ten years old
2253	5	B	or so.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	2	B	which is about the developmental level that, you know, you need to be at to read those things,
2253	4	B	and i still even then i was  so, so disgusted with it i, i  tried to read, i don't remember which other one it was,
2253	4	B	whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	B	and i just, i got about like a hundred pages through it and realized i had like a thousand more,
2253	4	B	i thought, i can't do this.
2253	6	A	yeah,
2253	5	A	it really
2253	2	A	the, the books are kind of, uh, imposing to say the least.
2253	6	B	yeah.
2253	21	A	no,
2253	21	A	let's see,
2253	4	A	here's one called ghost towns and mining camps of new mexico
2253	2	A	now, not too many people have read that one
2253	2	A	i don't think.
2253	3	B	no.
2253	4	A	and there's the history of yoakum county, texas there.
2253	16	B	<Laughter>.
2253	5	A	i've got, uh,
2253	13	B	is that a big, thick book?
2253	19	A	yeah,
2253	4	A	and i've got, yeah, and i've got a history of kingsley, iowa.
2253	20	B	what the, what the hell for?
2253	20	B	why kingsley, iowa?
2253	4	A	well, because that's where my folks all came from.
2253	14	B	oh, okay.
2253	4	A	and they had a centennial here awhile back.
2253	4	A	i read the grant takes command,
2253	4	A	that was pretty good.
2253	5	B	well,
2253	4	A	that was part of that trilogy that, uh,
2253	5	B	now  that's one that,
2253	7	A	bruce canton did.
2253	7	B	that's one
2253	28	B	i don't know.
2253	4	B	see, i had never really been into science fiction that much until, uh, somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	B	i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy.
2253	2	A	sometimes it's awful hard,
2253	2	A	some of those get very philosophical
2253	2	A	they can be in any setting,
2253	2	A	they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting, you know,
2253	5	A	the,
2253	4	B	well, i loved that novel.
2253	4	B	and then somebody said, oh, god, this would have been even long ago because i was in boston
2253	4	B	and it was raining all night,
2253	4	B	and i had a hole in my roof
2253	4	B	and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse,
2253	16	A	<Laughter>.
2253	7	B	and, uh, i was reading dune.
2253	6	A	oh.
2253	7	B	which seeming rather ironic.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	B	and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out, you know, like ten-gallon buckets of, of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and,
2253	6	A	uh-huh,
2253	6	A	you're reading dune.
2253	7	B	reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits
2253	4	B	and,
2253	16	A	<Laughter>.
2253	7	B	i think that's probably my favorite of, of any piece of science fiction that i've ever read.
2253	13	A	that was a movie too, wasn't it?
2253	23	B	and the movie was awful.
2253	18	A	was it?
2253	19	B	oh, yes,
2253	4	B	it was just terrible.
2253	6	A	yeah,
2253	4	A	i'd, i didn't see it
2253	5	A	but, uh,
2253	5	A	yeah.
2253	5	B	it was, it was beyond, uh,
2253	4	A	patrick stewart was in that.
2253	13	A	i guess the guy that's on the new star trek series was in that thing, uh .
2253	27	B	i don't know,
2253	4	B	i just remember sting was in it.
2253	18	A	oh, really? .
2253	19	B	yeah,
2253	2	B	and if you were trying to follow any type of, uh, plot, it, it total-,
2253	4	B	even having read the book, and i've read that book probably three times,
2253	6	A	uh-huh.
2253	7	B	watching that movie, i couldn't figure out,
2253	5	A	couldn't,
2253	7	B	what they were talking about,
2253	16	A	<Laughter>.
2253	7	B	at all.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	B	i was real disappointed in that.
2253	21	B	well, i'll tell you another good book,
2253	13	B	do you like scary things?
2253	21	A	um, well, some history,
2253	5	B	have you,
2253	7	A	books are pretty scary,
2253	5	A	but,
2253	19	A	yeah .
2253	3	B	that's true.
2253	13	B	have you read, the silence of the lambs?
2253	26	A	no.
2253	4	A	somebody who,
2253	14	B	oh.
2253	7	A	saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen,
2253	4	A	they didn't sleep all night.
2253	4	B	well, see i, i am debating whether or not i want to go see the movie after having read the book.
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	4	B	i mean the book is, is chilling.
2253	6	A	yeah,
2253	5	A	i have,
2253	4	B	just chilling.
2253	26	A	no, uh,
2253	4	A	i don't have the foggiest notion what it's about,
2253	5	A	so.
2253	4	B	then i won't tell you.
2253	6	A	okay,
2253	6	A	yeah .
2253	5	A	but,
2253	4	B	it's just that if you're ever, ever really want to just be scared out of your wits,
2253	6	A	uh-huh,
2253	13	A	that's the one.
2253	23	B	that's the one.
2253	19	B	yes.
2253	13	A	even better than jaws and some of that?
2253	19	B	yes,
2253	4	B	because the cat-,  the, the character  that is so horrible is another human being.
2253	4	B	and you're just drawn into his, his horror,
2253	16	A	<Laughter>.
2253	7	B	of him that you,
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	7	B	begin to kind of like him.
2253	6	A	oh.
2253	5	B	i mean,
2253	13	A	a, a freddy kruger type, huh?
2253	26	B	no,
2253	26	B	no.
2253	4	B	this guy's smart
2253	4	B	and he's suave
2253	4	B	and he's  all the charac-,  all the,
2253	24	A	oh the worst kind,
2253	5	A	yeah,
2253	7	B	characteristics,
2253	6	A	yeah.
2253	30	B	yeah,
2253	5	B	all the characteristics ...
2289	0	A	okay,
2289	11	A	we, we can, uh, be recorded while we talk about it.
2289	3	B	okay,
2289	13	B	well is your,
2289	13	B	does your city have mandatory, uh, recycling?
2289	26	A	no,
2289	4	A	we don't have mandatory.
2289	2	A	we, actually, we're kind of slow up here,
2289	4	A	and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer.
2289	4	A	and it's all voluntary.
2289	4	A	so that's interesting.
2289	13	A	cities have a mandatory recycling?
2289	23	B	um, there, there're some places that are strongly encouraging it,
2289	4	B	and that they city will pick it up.
2289	4	B	that's been one of the arguments here.
2289	4	B	i'm just sitting here looking. we've got four bins of glass and plasticine  stuff.
2289	4	B	but we have to carry it, uh, some distance,
2289	4	B	and some places, um, you can sell your, uh, recyclables,
2289	4	B	and, for example, our church was collecting newspapers.
2289	6	A	yeah,
2289	4	A	when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing.
2289	4	A	we got like a penny a pound for them.
2289	4	B	well, it turns out that so much,
2289	4	B	the problem in texas is that, uh, they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to, uh, reprocess it.
2289	9	A	oh, my,
2289	4	B	it requires an ex-, it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it,
2289	4	B	and so the value has gone down.
2289	4	B	it turns out it wasn't worth for the church to do.
2289	9	A	oh, i didn't realize,
2289	2	A	you would think,
2289	2	A	now up here, i, i suppose they send it all back to the mill
2289	4	A	and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of, uh.
2289	4	A	actually there is one in northern vermont.
2289	4	A	so there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here.
2289	4	A	i didn't think that,
2289	2	A	you know, in the large city that if the next recycling, if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away
2289	5	B	well,
2289	7	A	it's a lot of money to transport.
2289	6	B	yeah,
2289	5	B	well see, that's,
2289	4	B	in, in dallas there no plan to build,
2289	4	B	i think there, there's some in east texas there's some pulp mills,
2289	4	B	but, uh, you have to go to houston,
2289	4	B	and, it's interesting,
2289	4	B	and then there's places that will buy metal
2289	4	B	and they still buy aluminum can and likes that. / *can - cans ? likes - like?
2289	8	A	do you have to buy metal,
2289	2	A	like copper is a very good one to collect.
2289	2	A	even aluminum,
2289	5	A	yeah,
2289	5	A	so.
2289	13	B	well, do you do, do you do recycling?
2289	23	A	uh, we do the recycling,
2289	4	A	and our city will pick up our recyclables.
2289	6	B	oh.
2289	4	A	they have these little blue bins.
2289	4	A	um, i don't recycle personally.
2289	4	A	i, i'm saying i want to do it,
2289	4	A	but, i don't get a lot of magazines,
2289	4	A	i don't get a,
2289	4	A	i don't buy the newspaper,
2289	4	A	but i do have a lot of, uh,
2289	4	A	my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cart-, a lot of different papers and cardboards.
2289	13	B	well, do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans?
2289	19	A	yes,
2289	4	A	but we have a bottle return.
2289	4	A	a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles.
2289	4	A	we've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years.
2289	29	B	oh, so it's worth taking them back.
2289	4	B	well, see, we don't have.
2289	4	B	we have, we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles.
2289	2	A	oh, they should definitely get, um, the nickel returnable.
2289	2	A	it's great for the kids, because
2289	4	A	see, a lot of the kids get the money from it,
2289	2	A	and it's great for the boy scouts running around, they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes.
2289	4	B	oh, that's it,
2289	5	B	you'll, you'll,
2289	4	B	there is a down side to all this, you know, about no good deed going unpunished,
2289	16	A	
2289	7	B	that, uh, my mother sells, um, trees that they make paper out of,
2289	4	B	and so every time i recycle newspapers, in fact there's a, there's a, uh,
2289	4	B	kimberly and clark, the makers of kleenex and such
2289	6	A	yeah.
2289	7	B	has a, uh, a big paper mill.
2289	4	B	in fact i almost went to work for them.
2289	4	B	i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me.
2289	4	B	it's twenty or thirty miles from my house.
2289	4	B	every time you recycle, that's one less tree my mother can sell,
2289	4	B	and, uh. so, it's a question should i be diligent   and,  um,
2289	24	A	and recycle.
2289	7	B	and,   and  recycle, and put my mother out of her livelihood.
2289	6	A	oh, yes,
2289	9	A	i see that.
2289	4	B	but, it's an interesting point, though, that, you know, everybody's so anxious to recycle,
2289	2	B	and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment,
2289	5	B	but,
2289	24	A	but it takes away employment from the resource
2289	5	A	and its .
2289	2	B	well, but in general i think it's a good idea because
2289	3	A	i do, too.
2289	7	B	like the glass, you can't argue that the glass,
2289	4	B	it doesn't biodegrade, and, and, uh, the plastics obviously,
2289	4	A	they don't either
2289	2	B	so we might as well recycle those.
2289	6	A	yeah,
2289	2	A	like i say, it's not a very controversial thing.
2289	2	A	everyone thinks we should do it.
2289	2	A	it's just that we're so lazy,
2289	4	A	i mean, like personally, i don't want to clean my,
2289	4	A	i just have can cat food.
2289	4	A	i don't want to clean the can and take the label off it, and put it in a separate bin.
2289	6	B	yeah.
2289	4	A	you know, i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash.
2289	4	B	well, that's what we've got.
2289	4	B	we started about, new year's we decided we'd get ambitious.
2289	4	B	well, we took one load over there,
2289	4	B	and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff,
2289	4	B	and, you know, it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there.
2289	6	A	yeah,
2289	4	A	i think i would be like,
2289	4	A	when i bring my bottles back. if they're pretty clean and stuff, so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months,
2289	4	A	and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them ov-, and bring them over.
2289	4	A	now, if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean, like if i washed all the cans and things, i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much,
2289	4	A	but if, if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it.
2289	4	A	but, um, i produce quite a bit of trash,
2289	4	A	my, you know, house,
2289	4	A	and i see it,
2289	4	A	but i don't see so much that i can recycle.
2289	6	B	yeah.
2289	4	A	like i say, it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard.
2289	4	A	i'm not a real plastic person user, but a lot of paper, um, pretty much,
2289	4	A	and i don't know how they sort that.
2289	4	A	but if, if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles, i would think that i wou-, i would have a recycling center.
2289	4	A	but now, it's just me and my husband,
2289	28	A	so, i don't know.
2289	2	B	but every little bit helps,
2289	33	B	right.
2289	19	A	yeah,
2289	4	A	i know what you're saying.
2289	4	A	but we have, we have a very aggressive recycling at work,
2289	4	A	and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin.
2289	2	A	see, some people, it's, the recycle bin is on their way out.
2289	2	A	instead of carrying your newspapers, when they get done with them at the end of the day, they throw them in the trash.
2289	13	B	well, do you have separate trash cans at your desk.
2289	26	A	um, no,
2289	4	A	we don't,
2289	4	A	but other, other offices do.
2289	4	A	they have a box for papers.
2289	4	B	well, we have, we have one that's recyclable and, and then for uh, lunch sacks and waste food
2289	4	B	and they gave us a list of things that aren't re-,
2289	4	B	and it turns out it's not so bad.
2289	4	B	i, i get a lot of reports that, that are covered in plastic or plas-, like saran wrap or something, d anyway,
2289	4	B	and then, uh, cardboard, there's a few,
2289	4	B	it's interesting that we're, we're recycling computer type paper.
2289	6	A	yeah.
2289	4	B	and, and, uh, one day they'll pick up, uh,
2289	4	B	the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper,
2289	4	B	and then the next day they'll pick up the other,
2289	5	B	so.
2289	6	A	oh.
2289	4	B	depending on how much,
2289	4	B	you know, and there's a lot of, actually, it works pretty well,
2289	4	B	and then we have a, uh, waste, uh, cans for aluminum in the, in the break areas at work.
2289	4	A	well, that's, that's a really good idea, because, um, like our, uh, fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit.
2289	6	B	yeah.
2289	2	A	and they're thinking about putting a deposit on them, because pretty much you have to, you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans, where they're
2289	6	B	yeah,
2289	7	A	so much easier just to put a deposit on it, because most, probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits, because they're beer and soda,
2289	4	A	but when they sell juice, it's some strange quirk in the law, you don't have to have a deposit on it.
2289	4	A	and even like, the, a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it,
2289	4	A	but if it's got soda in it, it does.
2289	4	A	so, it's a strange.
2289	4	B	that's an interesting distinction.
2289	6	A	yeah,
2289	2	A	they should, they should clean, clear that up.
2289	4	A	it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the, uh, juice cans as easily as the soda.
2289	6	B	yeah.
2289	4	A	so, but redemption centers are a big thing up here,
2289	4	A	they get a penny a can they handle.
2289	4	A	they give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor.
2289	2	A	i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can.
2289	4	B	well, see, well, see, those of us that don't have state income taxes,
2289	4	B	yet
2289	6	A	yeah.
2289	7	B	that's the big debate here in texas, that the legislature wants to put one in,
2289	4	B	and, it's interesting what people get upset about,
2289	4	B	uh, it really is.
2289	13	A	is bot-, is bottle return down there a heated debate?
2289	26	B	well, no,
2289	4	B	the, the big issue was, is, is, when we moved here a few years ago, is whether it was okay for you, to, uh, drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck.
2289	14	A	oh, yeah.
2289	7	B	and throw it out at the in uh,
2289	4	A	well, we,
2289	0	A	well, here you can't drink,
2289	4	B	we're not civilized now, you can no longer, you cannot drink beer and drive,
2289	4	B	but --
2289	5	A	well.
2289	7	B	but  it was, it was actually legal.
2289	6	A	yes,
2289	4	A	well, i know, i was in atlanta,
2289	4	A	and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand.
2289	4	A	but here, let me put that in a paper cup for you.
2289	16	B	
2289	4	A	so that was strange.
2289	2	A	but, i think,
2289	2	A	if some people they have,
2289	2	A	they say, well, we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these, um, the, the recycle center, you have to deal with the can and then you have to, to recycle it,
2289	2	A	and, their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits
2289	6	B	yeah.
2289	7	A	see how they handle it,
2289	4	A	and see if it's a good way,
2289	4	A	and then do it that way. because, as, like i say, people are making money on it.
2289	2	B	well, you know,  the other,
2289	4	A	the cans do, are worth something.
2289	7	B	well the other  thing is, it also is, is a, is a, a good habit, uh, to, uh, just to conserve resources, you know, where they, you know, because you get in the habit of that, you think in terms of, of, uh, of, of things like saving
2299	1	A	so what do you think about it?
2299	1	A	how are we doing in recycling?
2299	5	A	are we,
2299	2	B	well, i think we need to do more.
2299	4	B	i mean, i know i need to do more.
2299	4	B	they have programs around where you can reach the, uh,
2299	4	B	they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up.
2299	6	A	uh-huh.
2299	4	B	but i have a hard time of being able, of separating, you know,  having a place, separating  my trash,
2299	4	B	and get all the
2299	6	A	yeah.
2299	7	B	cans from the paper,
2299	4	B	and, you know, i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet .
2299	5	B	so.
2299	4	A	i do a lot of work with the boy scouts,
2299	4	A	and we try to do a lot
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	4	A	but there's still a lot more we can do.
2299	6	B	yeah.
2299	4	A	you know, i don't recycle my newspapers myself,
2299	4	A	but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a, like a, a clothes hamper kind of thing that, you know, you lay your string in, then you put your papers in there
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	7	A	tie them all up and bundle them up,
2299	4	A	so i figured i might get me one of those
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	7	A	because we don't always read the newspaper.
2299	4	A	sometimes it just sits around for a while,
2299	4	A	and then we just chuck it.
2299	6	B	yeah,
2299	4	B	well, i don't, i don't get the paper every day,
2299	4	B	but, you know, i get it on,
2299	4	B	i try to buy, you know, the early edition for the coupons, you know, the sunday edition.
2299	5	B	so.
2299	6	A	yeah.
2299	4	B	but, then i just, you know, bundle it up and put it on the front, you know, the front walk  ev-, --
2299	6	A	yeah.
2299	7	B	you know, every  monday or every other monday, and have them pick that up,
2299	4	B	but that's the extent of what i've done.
2299	4	B	i'd like to be able to do more.
2299	4	B	the problem is, with a lot of it is, you have to go, you know, it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it, you know
2299	6	A	yeah
2299	5	A	see, and,
2299	4	B	it's not always convenient to do it.
2299	6	A	yeah,
2299	4	A	see, and here in lubbock everything's so close.
2299	4	A	i can imagine what it's like up there.
2299	6	B	yeah,
2299	4	B	i'm not exactly sure where the, you know, the can thing is,
2299	4	B	but, you know, sometimes it's just so,
2299	4	B	seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have
2299	6	A	yeah.
2299	7	B	them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them.
2299	4	A	see, i went out to payless cashways here a couple of days ago, as a matter of fact, and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	4	A	and then i put me a little five gallon bucket,
2299	4	A	and it's just outside the garage door
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	4	A	so every time we drink a coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket.
2299	13	B	do those can crushers work good?
2299	19	A	yeah,
2299	4	A	i got one from payless cashways,
2299	4	A	and it's actually metal
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	4	A	it's not plastic.
2299	4	A	i didn't want to buy a plastic one.
2299	3	B	yeah
2299	2	B	because those things i think would just snap
2299	6	A	yeah.
2299	7	B	you know.
2299	4	A	but payless cashways has them
2299	4	A	and they're metal,
2299	4	A	and i don't know what affiliate of payless cashways you have up there,
2299	4	A	but it was only like seven dollars, not too bad.
2299	6	B	oh.
2299	4	B	i'd have to check into something like that, because, i mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know,
2299	4	B	but, um
2299	6	A	yeah.
2299	7	B	you know, occasionally we have some around,
2299	13	B	but, you know, for other kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they.
2299	19	A	yeah,
2299	5	A	i don't,
2299	19	A	yeah,
2299	4	A	i don't think it would crush steel cans,
2299	4	A	it's pretty tough.
2299	6	B	yeah,
2299	28	B	so. i don't know,
2299	4	B	i don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that,
2299	4	B	but,
2299	6	A	no,
2299	2	A	you could probably just, you know,
2299	7	B	i need to look into it more,
2299	5	B	you know, it's, you know, it,
2299	4	B	sometimes, even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper, you know,
2299	4	B	they won't take
2299	6	A	yeah
2299	7	B	paper that's shiny,
2299	4	A	they won't, yeah, they won't take any lint free paper
2299	4	A	or, see, i work at t i.
2299	6	B	yeah,
2299	4	B	so does my husband,
2299	5	B	yeah.
2299	4	A	we do a lot of recycling out there.
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	4	A	now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard,
2299	4	A	but that's just now come on board.
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	4	A	you know, we've been throwing paper out there away for years,
2299	4	A	and we're just now getting on board to recycling
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	7	A	ever since this big earth day thing came out, you know.
2299	6	B	yeah,
2299	5	B	i don't know what,
2299	5	B	you know, i haven't,
2299	2	B	i'm sure they're probably doing that here some.
2299	3	A	yeah,
2299	2	A	i'm sure they are.
2299	4	A	t i is doing it pretty well nation-wide, i'm sure.
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	2	B	i think it's necessary,
2299	4	B	i, i like it,
2299	5	B	you know, it makes,
2299	4	B	i think it's good that you see these, you know, like boxes, cereal,
2299	4	B	they're now starting to make them, you know, the packages out of recycled paper,
2299	4	B	and,
2299	6	A	oh, yeah.
2299	7	B	and  i've bought, you know, i've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper,
2299	4	B	and i think they're just fine.
2299	6	A	yeah,
2299	4	A	i bought a,
2299	4	A	i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work,
2299	4	A	it's his birthday,
2299	4	A	we're pretty good friends,
2299	4	A	and what it is is a recycled paper bag
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	4	A	and it's just got happy birthday printing on it, and a cute little phrase inside,
2299	4	A	and it's just a paper bag
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	4	A	you know, and it's really cute.
2299	6	B	yeah.
2299	2	A	but, i think we're doing better and better all the time,
2299	6	B	yeah
2299	5	A	still don't,
2299	2	B	i think we're getting, becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more.
2299	5	B	so.
2299	3	A	no,
2299	2	A	there's not going to be any room, shortly.
2299	3	B	no,
2299	3	B	no,
2299	5	B	the office,
2299	4	A	i don't know what new york does about theirs.
2299	2	A	i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere.
2299	3	B	yeah,
2299	2	B	it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere .
2299	6	A	yeah,
2299	2	A	so. but i think we're getting better at it
2299	6	B	yeah.
2299	2	A	i think there's quite a bit more we could do.
2299	35	B	girls, put that away.
2299	35	B	now.
2299	4	A	but, you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth.
2299	6	B	yeah,
2299	4	B	i just wish it was a little more conv-, convenient
2299	6	A	yeah.
2299	7	B	to do,
2299	4	B	you know, seems like you're so busy anyway,
2299	4	B	and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about.
2299	5	B	so.
2299	3	A	yeah,
2299	9	A	it sure is.
2299	2	B	i think if, you know, the cities, locally, you know, they'd get more programs going so that you could do that, it'd make it a lot easier.
2299	5	B	so.
2299	6	A	yeah,
2299	6	A	yeah.
2299	2	A	well, they'll get at it sooner.
2299	2	A	i guess the schools will get into it, too, sooner or later.
2299	6	B	yeah,
2299	6	B	yeah,
2299	2	B	get the kids
2299	5	A	you know they have,
2299	7	B	interested in it too.
2299	4	A	we tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have,
2299	4	A	and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans.
2299	6	B	yeah.
2299	4	A	you know, if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people, sure they'll save them for us, there's no problem there.
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	8	A	but what do you do with them in the meantime?
2299	9	B	that's right.
2299	4	A	now i don't want a can, a garage full of cans .
2299	9	B	that's right,
2299	8	B	who does.
2299	2	B	you know
2299	5	A	you know.
2299	7	B	people don't have room for that kind of stuff.
2299	3	A	no,
2299	2	A	they're just not, they're not prepared for it.
2299	3	B	no,
2299	4	B	and in texas, they're just get, things like that,
2299	4	B	they just get bugs in them.
2299	5	B	so.
2299	3	A	yeah,
2299	3	A	yeah,
2299	4	A	they do.
2299	5	B	so, you don't,
2299	4	A	you know, the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get,
2299	4	A	that's for sure.
2299	9	B	that's right,
2299	5	B	so.
2299	5	A	so.
2299	4	B	i'm pretty lazy about it right now.
2299	4	B	everything goes into one thing and goes out to the .
2299	6	A	yeah.
2299	4	B	you know, pick it up.
2299	5	B	so.
2299	6	A	yeah,
2299	5	A	myself.
2299	4	A	about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans.
2299	6	B	uh-huh.
2299	5	A	so.
2299	4	B	well, i need to get, get better at it.
2299	5	B	so.
2299	2	A	well, if we all try a little bit, a little bit goes a long way.
2299	3	B	yeah,
2299	9	B	that's right,
2299	9	B	that's right.
2299	2	A	if everybody tries to do just a little bit, and a little bit more then
2299	9	B	that's true.
2299	7	A	we'll get there.
2299	9	B	that's right.
2299	12	A	well
2299	5	B	huh.
2299	7	A	thank you for talking to me.
2299	12	B	well, thank you for calling.

2340	5	A	okay
2340	19	B	yes.
2340	6	A	yeah,
2340	4	A	i'm actually working tonight,
2340	4	A	i just, uh, called and came in.
2340	6	B	oh are you.
2340	13	A	do you work at t i?
2340	19	B	yeah,
2340	13	B	you?
2340	19	A	yeah,
2340	4	A	i just got a little booklet, uh, this not what we're supposed to talk about, just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts,
2340	4	A	and i thought, i better make some calls.
2340	3	B	i know,
2340	3	B	i know,
2340	5	B	they.
2340	6	A	yeah.
2340	4	A	well, i haven't had a chance, i haven't got a chance to look at them yet.
2340	4	B	it was a lot nicer than i expected.
2340	4	A	my daughter, uh, got a few calls at home.
2340	4	A	she talked to some student in,
2340	4	A	i guess they give them to computer students, too, in, uh, virginia, something like that.
2340	4	A	she's talked to two students.
2340	4	B	i've talked to,
2340	4	B	i don't think they were students,
2340	4	B	one, i think, worked at a university, university
2340	6	A	yeah.
2340	7	B	um, and the furthest away i've talked to someone has been new york.
2340	6	A	oh, yeah,
2340	9	A	great.
2340	11	A	uh, we're supposed to talk about the elderly now, i guess, uh,
2340	3	B	yes,
2340	3	B	we are.
2340	13	A	do you have anybody that you, uh, are close to that decision on, or anything,
2340	4	A	or, i've thought about it for myself and all,
2340	4	A	and my wi-, my wife's mother is in a retirement home.
2340	4	A	she's not in a nursing home. uh.
2340	5	B	oh, well that's a,
2340	13	B	did you push the button?
2340	19	A	yeah,
2340	13	A	did i, didn't we push?
2340	13	B	did we,
2340	4	A	let me, i'll hit it again just in case.
2340	6	B	okay,
2340	4	B	just in case .
2340	4	A	i did it as she said,
2340	5	A	yes.
2340	4	A	but, uh,  she's --
2340	5	B	now, what,
2340	7	A	she's  down in san antonio
2340	6	B	oh.
2340	4	A	and it's, it's a, uh, it's a brand new one.
2340	4	A	it's a catholic, uh, retirement home for nuns.
2340	4	A	it's at, uh
2340	6	B	oh.
2340	7	A	trinity, uh,
2340	31	A	no,
2340	21	A	let me see, trinity,
2340	4	A	i keep calling it trini-,
2340	31	A	it's not trinity,
2340	5	A	i'll think of,
2340	4	A	incarnate word,
2340	4	A	and they have a retirement home for the nuns
2340	9	B	well, isn't that neat.
2340	4	A	and they take some lay people.
2340	9	B	isn't that neat.
2340	3	A	yeah,
2340	4	A	and that one's really super.
2340	4	A	now i, i know what they're talking about on regular retirement.
2340	5	A	yeah,
2340	5	A	there's not too many,
2340	4	A	they do have a wing where the people who are really sick, you know
2340	6	B	uh-huh.
2340	7	A	have nurses.
2340	9	B	oh, that's good.
2340	4	A	and then they have other wings that we visited, uh, that are very nice.
2340	4	A	i mean it's just super.
2340	9	B	that's neat.
2340	13	B	just supervised more or less than anything and security, i guess.
2340	19	A	oh, yeah,
2340	4	A	they, they, they have, uh, like, uh, a guard with locks.
2340	4	A	we've been there once at night at christmas.
2340	4	A	she just went in last year.
2340	14	B	oh.
2340	4	A	she drives and everything,
2340	4	A	she, she, she's perfectly healthy.
2340	6	B	uh-huh.
2340	6	A	uh,
2340	20	B	what made you all decide to put her, or what made her decide to go?
2340	4	A	well, her husband died.
2340	4	A	they were in the military together,
2340	4	A	and she just did not want to take care of the house
2340	6	B	right
2340	16	B	,
2340	4	A	and she visited the place, and then fell in love with it, and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind,
2340	16	B	<Laughter>.
2340	7	A	so to speak,
2340	4	A	and so
2340	9	B	well, that's good.
2340	7	A	she's happy as, as heck,
2340	4	A	and they serve meals, of course.
2340	9	B	that's great.
2340	4	A	they have clubs and a swimming pool,
2340	9	A	so that's nice.
2340	4	A	now i, i know the ones where you're really ill, we visited a long time ago when
2340	6	B	uh-huh.
2340	7	A	she had a grandmother that was in one.
2340	4	A	and they were all more or less hospitalized type
2340	6	B	right.
2340	7	A	you know, really, really sick.
2340	5	B	shut-ins and,
2340	2	A	it's a tough question.
2340	3	B	yeah,
2340	3	B	it really is.
2340	4	B	i worked in one as a teenager.
2340	4	B	i volunteered,
2340	4	A	oh, you got more experience than i do then on it.
2340	4	B	well, it was really, it was really sad, heartbreaking, i guess.
2340	3	A	yeah,
2340	3	A	yeah.
2340	4	B	and, uh, i just, oh, i just felt for those people, especially the ones that never got visited.
2340	2	A	# oh, that would be awful. #
2340	4	B	# that just bothered me. #
2340	4	A	i never thought about that, you know.
2340	4	B	that just bothered me so much, especially, you know, at my age,
2340	4	B	i was probably about fourteen.
2340	6	A	uh-huh.
2340	4	B	and that really made a bad impression on me .
2340	4	B	i always thought, not really bad of them, i mean, because they are, most of them i believe are probably pretty good for the people,
2340	28	B	but, i don't know.
2340	2	B	it's just a, it would be a tough, tough decision.
2340	3	A	yeah,
2340	2	A	i think that, uh, hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it,
2340	2	A	and they're getting nicer.
2340	6	B	right.
2340	4	A	i've seen on t v where they take animals and young children,
2340	4	A	in fact my daughter is one.
2340	4	A	my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school, took them to an elderly home,
2340	2	A	and boy that really pumps them up.
2340	3	B	helps,
2340	3	B	yeah.
2340	2	A	that is very nice to see young people.
2340	2	A	i think that's one of the sad things, is when you're in an older home.
2340	3	B	uh-huh,
2340	3	B	uh-huh.
2340	2	A	if you just have people your own age, you never get a chance to see kids or anything
2340	6	B	right.
2340	7	A	or animals or anything, you know
2340	6	B	right.
2340	2	A	you can't take care of them,
2340	2	A	kind of obvious you can't take care of children or animals
2340	6	B	right.
2340	7	A	in a nursing home,
2340	2	A	but it's nice to have them visit and everything.
2340	3	B	yeah,
2340	2	B	and get that youth back.
2340	6	A	yeah.
2340	2	B	you know, sometimes that even helps them, just being around young people to, because some of them are so, um, just stationary
2340	6	A	right.
2340	2	B	i mean, they'll get in a wheelchair
2340	2	B	or they'll just sit in a chair
2340	2	B	and, and, until you come along and really try and pump them up, they're just stationary,
2340	4	B	and i feel like, gosh, that's all they do all day long.
2340	4	B	so i do, love to see young kids go and, and men take the pets and everything.
2340	2	B	i think that's a real, real neat idea.
2340	3	A	yeah,
2340	2	A	i think you do get more by stimul-, by stimulation.
2340	4	A	my, in fact, my mother in law just visited.
2340	4	A	she's just about seventy-five. again, perfectly fine.
2340	6	B	yeah.
2340	4	A	but, one, and, and she visited us here in, in dallas.
2340	4	A	when she went back, every time she goes back to, uh, san antonio, my wife has two sisters there, too, she said she's much better,
2340	4	A	she's much more alive and, and, uh, active when she's been on a visit
2340	5	B	that's,
2340	7	A	with somebody else, you know
2340	6	B	yeah.
2340	4	A	and, and our routine has obviously hectic with teenagers and everything
2340	6	B	right.
2340	5	A	and she's much,
2340	2	A	and so the stimulation part is really important. i think, like any animal, anything
2340	6	B	right.
2340	2	A	you just lay around, uh, that's the fastest way to die, i think, you know.
2340	3	B	stagnant .
2340	3	B	yeah,
2340	3	B	that's exactly right.
2340	2	B	i think they're really neat.
2340	4	B	um, of course i've seen those reports on t v, the horrible ones
2340	6	A	oh, yeah.
2340	4	B	and that scares me.
2340	4	A	i'm afraid i'm a t v flipper.
2340	4	A	anything bad,   i like,  i like to,
2340	16	B	<Laughter>.
2340	7	A	flip,   i flip it  off.
2340	2	A	but it's sad,
2340	2	A	it's sad,
2340	5	A	yeah.
2340	2	B	it's sad to think that we would do that to people,
2340	4	B	and you know, i've seen them on t v with, uh, bed sores,
2340	4	B	and
2340	6	A	oh, yeah.
2340	7	B	oh, they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry.
2340	4	B	and i just think, how can you do that?
2340	2	B	these people have given so much of their lives, you know, to, to america
2340	6	A	yeah.
2340	7	B	you know, whatever,
2340	2	B	and here is how we treat them.
2340	2	B	just put them in a home and leave them.
2340	3	A	right.
2340	4	A	when i was, uh, younger, we, i lived in the east,
2340	4	A	i'm from the east really,
2340	4	A	and it seemed like there were several people that i knew that had their, uh, parents, a i guess they would be, but well in their seve-,
2340	4	A	living with them.
2340	6	B	uh-huh .
2340	4	A	and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old,
2340	4	A	and i guess she,  she had her own separate room.
2340	4	A	and i think, whether it's more a custom up there, or maybe because i was younger --
2340	6	B	right.
2340	2	A	and it's just not a custom anymore to have, uh, you know, the grandparents live with you anymore.
2340	2	A	i guess that, uh
2340	5	B	i think,
2340	7	A	well, we aren't getting away from that, which is not right.
2340	3	B	right.
2340	2	B	i think it's neat.
2340	2	B	i think, uh, you learn a lot from them
2340	6	A	oh, yeah.
2340	7	B	from all their experiences,
2340	4	B	and, and that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories.
2340	6	A	oh, right,
2340	6	A	right.
2340	2	B	i think that's neat,
2340	2	B	because they really have a lot of good i-, insights
2340	6	A	yeah.
2340	7	B	that my fa-, my husband's father is really old.
2340	4	B	he, he had him late in life,
2340	4	B	and he's, he'll be eighty this year.
2340	6	A	oh.
2340	4	B	and i just, uh, he lives with different, you know, people in the family.
2340	4	B	he'll switch from time to time.
2340	5	B	i just,
2340	9	A	well, that's nice in a lot of ways.
2340	3	B	yeah,
2340	4	B	i just couldn't imagine locking,
2340	4	B	not locking him up, but putting him in a home and just,
2340	13	A	bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake.
2340	5	A	yeah,
2340	5	A	right,
2340	4	B	lock him up.
2340	4	A	that's what i think about it for me,
2340	4	A	i think, well, my kids better not do that to me.
2340	3	B	i know,
2340	3	B	i know.
2340	4	A	i don't want that, you know.
2340	4	A	so i, i think of it, well, how would i want to be treated
2340	3	B	right,
2340	3	B	exactly.
2340	7	A	rather than, well,
2340	2	A	it's easy to say, oh, yeah,
2340	33	A	let's put these old folks in a home,
2340	4	A	but when i think i don't want to do that, you know.
2340	4	A	i don't want to be --
2340	3	B	that's right.
2340	4	A	i'd want to have my little home.
2340	4	A	i always threaten my daughters,
2340	4	A	i say, well, i'm going to build a little house behind yours,
2340	16	B	<Laughter>.
2340	4	A	and i'll take care of your lawn, he says,
2340	33	A	but i'm not going to one of those places.
2340	33	B	oh, you're going to put me away.
2340	3	A	right,
2340	3	A	yeah.
2340	4	B	that's what my mother,
2340	5	B	she always,
2340	33	B	you're going to lock me up one day, aren't you.
2340	16	A	<Laughter>.
2340	33	B	i can tell,
2340	33	B	you're going to lock me up.
2340	2	A	that's what we, that's the way we call it, which is really wrong.
2340	3	B	i know.
2340	4	A	but my wife's mother, and the one, she's in san ant-,
2340	4	A	it's everything but.
2340	4	A	the opposite of what you've seen.
2340	4	A	i mean
2340	6	B	right.
2340	7	A	it's a little hotel, you might say.
2340	9	B	that's great.
2340	4	A	again, a swimming pool, and grounds,
2340	4	A	and she has enough room.
2340	4	A	she has two bedrooms, and a, and a
2340	9	B	gosh.
2340	7	A	separate living area.
2340	4	A	they don't have kitchens or anything
2340	6	B	right.
2340	4	A	but they have little, it's like uh, on each floor they have a little kitchen area
2340	6	B	yes.
2340	7	A	where you can go down and  have a --
2340	24	B	prepare your,
2340	7	A	make a  meal, you know.
2340	9	B	well, that's great.
2340	13	B	now can she leave, um, on a day by herself?
2340	19	A	oh, yeah,
2340	4	A	it's, it's, it's nothing like that.
2340	4	A	it's like living in the hotel.
2340	4	A	i mean
2340	9	B	oh, man.
2340	7	A	she's totally on her own.
2340	9	B	that's neat.
2340	4	A	uh, and she still drives, which we do, does scare us some, because she has dented a few things, you know,
2340	16	B	<Laughter>.
2340	4	A	and we keep thinking about that, you know
2340	6	B	right.
2340	2	A	because she, they get less alert,
2340	2	A	and they don't care,
2340	4	A	and i've seen some of these elderly people on t v you know, the ones from florida that just run into people
2340	4	A	and they don't even
2340	6	B	right.
2340	7	A	understand what happened, you know.
2340	3	B	i know,
2340	9	B	bless their hearts,
2340	2	B	you hate to hurt them by doing that,
2340	2	B	that's
2340	3	A	i know.
2340	7	B	like their one last thing that they can still do,
2340	2	B	and you take away that driving ability
2340	2	B	and that would really be hard.
2340	4	B	we've,
2340	3	A	i, i know.
2340	11	A	go ahead,
2340	10	A	i'm sorry.
2340	7	B	well, we've  thought about doing that for my husband's father, because he,
2340	13	A	oh, he still drives?
2340	19	B	yeah.
2340	9	A	that's gre-, well, it's wonderful in one respect,
2340	13	A	but i don't know if you can afford the insurance,
2340	5	A	yeah.
2340	39	B	well, luckily he drives a big old tank .
2340	6	A	yeah.
2340	2	B	so, he, i mean, i don't think  he, he  could get hurt.
2340	4	B	i just hope to god he doesn't ever hurt anyone.
2340	4	B	but  he --
2340	6	A	right.
2340	7	B	he  hasn't had any accidents luckily.
2340	9	A	that's good.
2340	2	A	i mean, people are all different.
2340	3	B	yeah,
2340	3	B	yeah.
2340	2	A	i, i wonder if they should give them a test, or at least maybe not take their licen-, maybe give them a refresher driving course, and just to see how well they are every five years.
2340	4	B	i saw that on twenty twenty.
2340	13	A	are they doing it?
2340	27	B	they, um, you know, they're testing that, they're, you know, thinking of doing that.
2340	2	B	and i think that would be a great idea, because i think they do, come, become less aware,
2340	2	B	and they just, i don't know, they, and they don't hear as well, for one thing
2340	6	A	yeah.
2340	2	B	and that doesn't help.
2340	2	A	well, everybody needs retraining.
2340	2	A	it doesn't hurt, uh,
2340	16	B	<Laughter>.
2340	7	A	you know,
2340	2	A	the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches,
2340	2	A	and i don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving.
2340	6	B	right.
2340	2	A	it would sure, the insurance companies  would, would probably  help pay for some of that, you know.
2340	2	B	at least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away .
2340	3	A	right,
2340	9	A	there you go,
2340	9	A	there's a good point
2340	2	B	it's on the state .
2340	9	A	very good point.
2340	9	A	very good point.
2340	2	A	but i think they maybe, should do that,
2340	5	A	and then the families,
2373	0	A	okay .
2373	13	B	was i supposed to do something?
2373	26	A	no.
2373	4	A	i had to press one.
2373	9	B	good .
2373	16	A	<Laughter>.
2373	21	B	uh, let's see,
2373	13	B	so, uh, were we right in the middle east?
2373	23	A	sure.
2373	13	B	should we have been there?
2373	19	A	uh-huh.
2373	13	B	did we do what was correct there?
2373	2	A	i think we should have stayed longer.
2373	13	B	should we have fought them harder?
2373	13	B	used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used?
2373	23	A	uh, i think what we did was good,
2373	2	A	but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do.
2373	13	B	oh, you agree with schwartzkopf who says, uh, drive on into baghdad.
2373	19	A	yeah.
2373	2	A	i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now.
2373	2	A	and it's almost like they're killing each other off
2373	2	A	and there is not going to be anything left of iraq at all .
2373	13	B	would that be so bad?
2373	13	B	was there anything there to begin with?
2373	2	A	well, i think, i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it, um.
2373	2	B	it wasn't ours.
2373	3	A	well, no,
2373	2	A	i just mean that, that, the world in general .
2373	2	B	we've got to talk so it's just, just as well we argue.
2373	3	A	yeah.
2373	28	A	um, i don't know,
2373	2	A	i think we should have helped the, the innocent people in iraq out a little bit more,
2373	3	B	i agree.
2373	7	A	than, rather than just quitting where we did.
2373	13	B	wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country.
2373	19	A	yes .
2373	2	A	but i think that's almost impossible, next to impossible.
2373	6	B	yeah.
2373	0	B	so other political things that's going on.
2373	4	B	i heard mister bush say, excuse me, president bush say that he, uh, wanted to improve the highways.
2373	4	A	oh, see, i haven't really been keeping up with them
2373	4	A	so i really don't know what he said.
2373	16	B	<Cough>.
2373	20	A	what did he say about it?
2373	2	B	oh, he wanted to take the current secondary highway system
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	7	B	and turn it into interstates like the rest of the country.
2373	2	A	we don't have the money for that.
2373	13	B	but wouldn't it be wonderful.
2373	23	A	it would be really nice because i'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes .
2373	13	B	and back east,
2373	16	A	<Beep>.
2373	7	B	you all drive at fifty-five, don't you?
2373	20	B	what's that?
2373	10	A	i'm sorry, i dropped the phone .
2373	14	B	oh, okay, um,
2373	13	B	i say back east you all drive at fifty-five don't you?
2373	19	A	yeah.
2373	4	B	see, out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fifty-five
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	4	B	we drive sixty-five.
2373	6	A	oh, really.
2373	19	B	oh, yes.
2373	0	A	.
2373	4	B	well, i, uh, last weekend, went home to visit my parents.
2373	4	B	my dad's in the hospital.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	4	B	and, uh, between here and west texas, there was probably three and four hours at sixty-five miles an hour.
2373	4	A	oh, i didn't realize that.
2373	4	B	nonstop.
2373	13	B	have you ever been out here?
2373	26	A	no,
2373	26	A	huh-uh.
2373	20	B	how far west have you been?
2373	4	A	only in ohio.
2373	13	B	oh, you've never,
2373	4	A	i've never been past ohio.
2373	7	B	you've never seen the great american desert.
2373	26	A	no,
2373	26	A	huh-uh.
2373	4	A	i've never seen anything out, i never seen the great,
2373	4	A	i've seen,
2373	13	B	the rocky mountains?
2373	36	A	i've never seen,
2373	4	A	i've seen pictures of it
2373	5	A	but,
2373	13	B	yellowstone?
2373	36	A	i've never been there.
2373	4	A	i've seen pictures,
2373	4	A	i just, i'm a college student
2373	4	A	and, um, i'm paying for my own education
2373	4	A	and i'm, i come from a large family
2373	4	A	and we, we we're never able to take vacations because there's, there's twelve kids in the family.
2373	5	B	uh,
2373	5	A	so,
2373	4	B	well, my college educa-, uh, thirty-six,
2373	4	B	worked for texas instruments for seventeen or eighteen now.
2373	9	A	oh, my.
2373	4	B	uh, know, virtually nothing else.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	6	B	uh, yeah.
2373	4	B	i  got my four year,
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	7	B	got my b s  in general science.
2373	6	A	really.
2373	19	B	yeah,
2373	4	B	i know,
2373	4	B	it's a funny degree .
2373	16	A	<Laughter>.
2373	4	B	anyway, uh, i know nothing other than the west.
2373	6	A	yeah.
2373	4	B	in fact, uh, down in east texas
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	7	B	where the company's located
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	7	B	there's streams and water and things i don't understand. trees and the gulf
2373	2	B	and it's really interesting.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	11	B	so tell me about where you live.
2373	4	A	well, um, i'm, i'm originally from butler
2373	4	A	and that's about an hour away from where i am now.
2373	4	A	i'm at clairon.
2373	4	A	and, um, it's, it's pretty, like, windy and hilly.
2373	20	B	uh, how high is the highest elevation?
2373	4	A	oh, i couldn't even tell you.
2373	5	B	like, uh, probably --
2373	4	A	it's not like a mountain.
2373	4	A	it wouldn't be like a mountain.
2373	5	A	it's, uh,
2373	13	B	three thousand feet?
2373	27	A	oh, i don't even know.
2373	4	A	i have no clue.
2373	13	B	close to sea level?
2373	23	A	i would say it's closer to sea level.
2373	6	B	okay,
2373	4	B	uh, right here in colorado springs where i live
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	7	B	it's over six thousand foot.
2373	5	A	oh, well, see, um, .
2373	6	B	um, yes
2373	4	B	when i lived in texas, every year i had to drive, you know.
2373	4	B	i drove every year to the gulf
2373	4	B	and, you know, so i could have a feast of fresh seafood
2373	7	A	uh-huh.
2373	7	B	six, eight, twelve hours away.
2373	5	A	um.
2373	7	B	you know, just, just for fresh.
2373	4	B	i, i'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of america.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	20	B	how many hours have you been from home?
2373	13	A	uh, the farthest away from home?
2373	19	B	yes.
2373	4	A	probab-, i'd say five or six.
2373	6	B	oh, yeah.
2373	19	A	uh-huh.
2373	4	B	uh, now when i was growing up in the panhandle of texas,
2373	4	B	look at your map later and see the, the town of amarillo
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	7	B	fifty miles north of that up in the panhandle.
2373	4	B	to just go buy a pair of jeans, we'd drive an hour.
2373	9	A	oh, my .
2373	9	A	oh, my gosh.
2373	4	B	when i was growing up,
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	7	B	now things are different
2373	4	B	and people buy jeans in town,
2373	4	B	but uh, we thought nothing at all of wake up, waking up in the morning hopping into your car, grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours.
2373	9	A	oh, yes.
2373	4	A	now see for me, that's a long ways.
2373	3	B	yeah.
2373	9	B	it is i imagine.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	4	A	even, well, like, i, i'm in like a little town right now.
2373	4	A	it's smaller than butler
2373	4	A	and, um, butler, butler is about an hour north east of pittsburgh.
2373	2	A	so that will give you some idea of where i'm at.
2373	6	B	okay.
2373	4	A	and  i'm about,
2373	6	B	okay,
2373	37	B	i'll look at my map later.
2373	7	A	i'm about  two hours north east of pittsburgh.
2373	9	B	wow.
2373	9	B	how neat.
2373	4	A	and, uh, i mean just this, this little town here is basically a college town.
2373	4	A	the college, without the college here, this town would be nothing.
2373	4	A	it would be absolutely dead.
2373	4	A	because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants
2373	4	A	and, and in the summer when we co-, uh,
2373	4	A	my fianc3ee's family lives up there, *typo
2373	4	A	we come up here in the summer,
2373	5	A	and it's,
2373	4	A	i mean, there's just no one around.
2373	13	B	so are you working your way through college?
2373	4	A	um, well, i go home in the summer
2373	4	A	and i work in the summer
2373	4	A	and between what i make in the summer and student loans, that's how i go to college.
2373	9	B	well, how neat.
2373	20	B	what's your major?
2373	4	A	finance.
2373	30	B	finance.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	9	B	well, that's interesting.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	20	B	so, uh, what do you plan to do with it?
2373	4	A	um, well, like i said my fianc3ee, - *typo
2373	13	B	savings and loans, uh,
2373	26	A	no .
2373	26	A	no,
2373	26	A	no,
2373	26	A	no,
2373	4	A	um, my fianc3ee works down in d c *typo
2373	4	A	and i'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a, something.
2373	4	A	i'd rather work for a company and, um, like be their financial advisor or something.
2373	9	B	oh, that would be great.
2373	9	B	that would be neat .
2373	4	B	let's see, uh, so we're all excited in colorado springs.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	4	B	apple computer is coming to town.
2373	6	A	oh, really.
2373	19	B	yes.
2373	4	B	the, uh, new employer is in the city.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	4	B	so we're expecting our local economy to ,
2373	24	A	take a boom a little bit.
2373	7	B	well, maybe not a boom, but, uh, at least, recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still.
2373	20	A	well, well what would be the unemployment rate out there?
2373	4	B	uh, unemployment runs approximately six percent.
2373	4	A	see that's what it is here too.
2373	4	B	but, now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent.
2373	6	A	uh-huh.
2373	4	B	and the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree.
2373	6	A	yeah.
2373	2	A	it's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs.
2373	3	B	yes.
2373	2	B	it is.
2373	4	A	i know people they are out of school for two or three years
2373	4	A	and they have a job that has nothing to do ...
2395	20	A	where do you get most of your news?
2395	4	B	i watch the macneil lehrer news hour,
2395	4	B	and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends.
2395	20	A	where, where are you?
2395	4	B	i'm in dallas.
2395	14	A	oh, yeah.
2395	13	B	are you in dallas also?
2395	26	A	no,
2395	4	A	i'm in san antonio.
2395	6	B	oh, really,
2395	14	B	okay.
2395	4	A	i get my news from a combination of sources.
2395	4	A	i take the paper every day
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	and i read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool.
2395	18	B	oh, really.
2395	19	A	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	and, uh, and i watch the, uh, actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work.
2395	4	A	and then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	7	A	from the news.
2395	4	B	i normally find that uh, i-, i'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,
2395	4	B	so i don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch.
2395	4	B	i, i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because i used to get it during the week
2395	6	A	uh-huh.
2395	4	B	but, um, i would always end up arriving at work late, because i would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time,
2395	16	A	<Laughter>.
2395	7	B	reading it in the morning.
2395	6	A	yeah.
2395	4	B	so i have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work.
2395	4	B	um, the macneil lehrer news hour is on public television
2395	6	A	uh-huh.
2395	4	B	and i enjoy that quite a bit.
2395	6	A	yeah.
2395	4	A	um, one of the women that i work with, her husband is iranian.
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	so here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
2395	4	B	i will admit i work with, uh, someone who's iranian,
2395	4	B	and he definitely has a very different slant on the news.
2395	6	A	uh-huh.
2395	4	B	he's very, very skeptical of the news media,
2395	4	B	and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also.
2395	4	B	but he's, i don't know, uh, he's mu-, much, much more so.
2395	4	B	it's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much, um, different perspective with all the gulf goings on, um.
2395	4	B	he was always speaking in terms of, you know, american imperialism reasserting itself.
2395	2	B	um, i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country.
2395	6	A	uh-huh .
2395	4	A	well i, i, uh, i like the print news
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	7	A	much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize.
2395	3	B	true, um,
2395	5	B	the,
2395	2	A	i understand that the macneil lehrer probably doesn't.
2395	4	B	they, um, tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story.
2395	6	A	uh-huh.
2395	4	B	they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time.
2395	4	B	sort of like the, uh, what is that, a b c's nightline.
2395	6	A	uh-huh.
2395	4	B	well, i guess they only normally stick with just the one, um, story.
2395	2	B	but they, they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories.
2395	29	A	they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in, in every little town.
2395	3	B	no,
2395	3	B	no.
2395	4	B	it's very much national interest news.
2395	6	A	yeah.
2395	4	B	a lot of times they end up, um, with these panels of experts
2395	4	B	and they go back and forth, where everyone's giving some opinions
2395	5	B	and sometimes that,
2395	4	B	i don't know the value of that, because i saw plenty of jokes and, and, um, oh, editorial cartoons about all the retired generals,
2395	16	A	<Laughter>.
2395	7	B	making a living during the, the gulf war.
2395	4	A	i've been getting a kick out of those lately.
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	5	A	although, um .
2395	4	A	i-, i'm only twenty-five,
2395	4	A	so i've never actually been through a period of war
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	and i don't know anyone in the military
2395	4	A	and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in, uh, military strategy and, and weaponry, and, and all that kind of stuff.
2395	2	A	and i thought the generals were very interesting.
2395	4	A	now when they started to speculate, i, i saw that for what is was,
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	7	A	and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on.
2395	2	A	but i thought the-, the-, they were interesting,
2395	4	A	and, and they shed some light on what was going on for me.
2395	3	B	i will admit it's interesting.
2395	4	B	i-, i-, i'm twenty-six.
2395	4	B	so i don't have any more experience in that than you.
2395	2	B	um, it, it, it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind, you know,
2395	4	B	there were some that were screaming for air power,
2395	4	B	there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it.
2395	6	A	uh-huh.
2395	2	B	and they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world, which i suppose just about everyone does,
2395	4	B	but these guys had a, a, uh, national soap box to stand on and, and express this view.
2395	4	A	you know, one of the best television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on a b c,
2395	4	A	and it was for children
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	and it was hosted by peter jennings,
2395	2	A	and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio,
2395	4	A	and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions.
2395	4	A	and they, they had all their correspondents in the different areas, in saudi arabia, and israel, and, and all.
2395	4	A	they had them all, uh, on,
2395	4	A	i don't know what you'd call it other than on line.
2395	4	A	they had them all on hold
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	and if a child asked a question that the person in jerusalem could best answer, they would cut to that person,
2395	4	A	and that person would answer the question.
2395	2	A	it was just very informative and interesting,
2395	4	A	and, uh, i was real impressed at how a b c handled, uh, translating,
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	7	A	the war for children.
2395	6	B	yeah,
2395	4	B	i didn't see anything like that, although i did, uh,
2395	4	B	i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting,
2395	28	B	this is getting a little off the topic,
2395	4	B	but there was a, a, a big push with the local t v stations to have little hot lines with counselors
2395	6	A	uh-huh.
2395	7	B	to, to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children.
2395	2	B	i thought that was a really unusual thing.
2395	4	A	and our local h e b stores here,
2395	4	A	i don't know if it's h e b statewide or whatever,
2395	4	A	but they have videos that, uh,
2395	4	A	i don't know if they still have them,
2395	4	A	but they were free rental,
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	7	A	videos, that had something to do with the war.
2395	5	B	ju-, --
2395	5	A	uh, it was,
2395	13	B	it-, with the children's aspect?
2395	23	A	right.
2395	4	A	it was something for children, that they, they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and, uh, getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	7	A	and that kind of thing.
2395	2	B	i suppose that is a valuable service.
2395	4	B	again not having, uh, lived through another war, i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of,
2395	4	B	or if that was
2395	4	A	well
2395	7	B	a new concern with people.
2395	7	A	back during the viet nam conflict that no one will, will have the guts enough to call a real war
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	uh, the, that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal.
2395	3	B	that's true.
2395	3	B	that's true.
2395	2	A	so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news.
2395	2	B	and  probably more importantly, one that lasted short enough that, that people's interest didn't flag too badly.
2395	3	A	yeah.
2395	0	A	i tell you what,
2395	4	A	the first three days, i was glued to the television.
2395	4	B	i will admit the same thing.
2395	4	B	and i,
2395	5	A	and i,
2395	7	B	would come home and flip on macneil lehrer
2395	4	B	and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program
2395	6	A	yeah.
2395	4	B	and i, i was just, i was horrified and fascinated by what i was seeing.
2395	0	A	i tell you what.
2395	4	A	the uh, the war start-,
2395	21	A	let's see, was it a wednesday or thursday?
2395	4	A	must have been thursday, uh,
2395	4	A	and friday night i was, i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open.
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	because i was watching c n n,
2395	4	A	and they would, they would switch back to one of their israel bureaus,
2395	4	A	and the people would be standing there in gas masks,
2395	4	A	and you'd be hearing the sirens,
2395	5	A	and it was just,
2395	4	A	i was amazed.
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	B	i, i didn't have that experience.
2395	4	B	i, i don't have cable
2395	6	A	oh.
2395	2	B	so i, i'm pretty much limited to p b s, which i thought, i thought they did a very good job.
2395	6	A	uh-huh.
2395	4	B	um, i've got one question for you.
2395	13	B	i  you say you take the newspaper.
2395	19	A	uh-huh.
2395	2	B	um, i, i found the newspaper situation in dallas very interesting.
2395	2	B	we've got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the times herald, and then the morning news, which has a very strong subscription.
2395	6	A	uh-huh.
2395	13	B	does san antonio ha-,
2395	13	B	you said san antonio, right?
2395	19	A	uh-huh.
2395	13	B	do you have just one paper,
2395	15	B	or do you have several?
2395	26	A	no.
2395	4	A	there are two,
2395	2	A	and they're pretty close.
2395	4	A	uh, the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper,
2395	4	A	i grew up near houston
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck,
2395	4	A	and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up. i mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff.
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	2	A	it's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over,
2395	16	B	<Laughter>.
2395	4	A	and i enjoy,
2395	2	A	the comics are better in this newspaper.
2395	16	B	<Laughter>.
2395	4	A	this newspaper has the far side and the comics that i enjoy
2395	4	A	and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of.
2395	5	A	so,
2395	4	B	i, i actually take both newspapers on the weekends.
2395	18	A	do you?
2395	4	B	i figure i'm only taking on the weekend,
2395	4	B	and i can afford that.
2395	6	A	yeah.
2395	4	B	i, i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better,
2395	4	B	but i sort of have a liberal political slant,
2395	2	B	and the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook.
2395	4	A	and  my,
2395	4	B	i get the times herald just to balance that out a little bit.
2395	7	A	my  fiancee takes probably six sunday papers.
2395	4	A	he takes both san antonio papers, an austin paper, both houston papers,
2395	4	A	i guess he takes seven, the san marcos paper and the new braunsfel paper,
2395	4	A	but he's a football coach at southwest texas state university,
2395	4	A	so he's getting all the sports sections.
2395	6	B	uh-huh.
2395	4	A	and, so, you know, he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that go unread ...
2399	0	A	okay, um,
2399	21	A	let's see.
2399	1	A	how do you feel about credit cards?
2399	4	B	personally, i do not care for them. uh, although i find them a necessity in business and so forth,
2399	4	B	i, i try to refrain from their use as much as possible. um, for a number of reasons, one of which is the, you know, extreme interest rate on most of them.
2399	6	A	uh-huh.
2399	4	B	the one i use, uh, of course, for mostly, only for business purposes is, uh, you know, american express.
2399	6	A	right.
2399	4	B	and, uh, i'm not i'm not terribly in favor of them.
2399	4	B	not for my own personal, uh, point of view.
2399	6	A	right.
2399	4	B	plus it, uh, has, you know, from an economic point of view it has increased our debt
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	7	B	tremendously
2399	6	A	right.
2399	7	B	to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion, i believe
2399	9	A	wow.
2399	4	B	uh, at least that's one number for this range of numbers i have, i have heard.
2399	6	A	right.
2399	13	B	do you use them frequently
2399	5	B	or,
2399	4	A	well, we, uh, me and my wife, when, when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have, and we can put it in our budget, yeah, we'll, we'll use it.
2399	4	A	but like last year, i think we paid,
2399	4	A	i think it was like twenty something cents interest,
2399	16	B	<Laughter>.
2399	7	A	on our visa.
2399	6	B	uh-huh.
2399	4	A	and i think this, this year we, uh, i think we used it for christmas,
2399	4	A	and we got caught just a few days on our grace period.
2399	4	A	and, uh, so we'll pay a little interest this year, but maybe two dollars.
2399	4	A	but we don't like to do that at all.
2399	6	B	yes.
2399	4	A	and, you know, we, i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly.
2399	4	A	we, uh, we have several credit cards, though.
2399	4	A	we have a gas card, our visa, and then, of course, the american express,
2399	4	A	and i think we have a couple of department stores.
2399	6	B	uh-huh.
2399	4	A	but, we use it the same way,
2399	5	A	and, uh,
2399	4	B	i find the one i use mostly, uh,
2399	4	B	aside from the american express, i do use my sears card.
2399	6	A	uh-huh.
2399	4	B	but, uh, i try,  a-, as with the american express, i try  to pay it, you know, as it comes in.
2399	6	A	right.
2399	6	A	right.
2399	5	B	so, uh,
2399	4	A	it's, it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill.
2399	4	A	that's usually how we do it.
2399	4	B	i know when i travel, or when i used to travel overseas quite a bit, what i would do on my american express card is before i would, before i left i would mail a check to, to american express
2399	6	A	uh-huh.
2399	7	B	and, you know, have some idea of how much was there, you know, a i'd sent them, you know, several hundred dollars, or whatever
2399	6	A	uh-huh.
2399	7	B	i felt i would spend.
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	7	B	and then use it then.
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	4	B	but, uh, for hotels and, and so forth.
2399	4	B	but, uh, but i knew that it was paid .
2399	4	B	i knew --
2399	6	A	right.
2399	7	B	i knew  that i had that much
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	7	B	credit, going in.
2399	4	B	sometimes, you know, sometimes i would go over,
2399	4	B	but it wouldn't, you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big, in a big way because
2399	6	A	right.
2399	7	B	i knew that, uh, i would have it covered in that respect.
2399	6	A	right.
2399	9	A	that's good.
2399	4	A	i've, i don't think we've gone that far ,
2399	16	B	<Laughter>.
2399	7	A	to pay it in ad-, you know, in advance before we spend it,
2399	2	A	but, i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it, that, like that,
2399	4	B	well,  i found --
2399	7	A	that  may be good.
2399	7	B	i found  in, um, in traveling overseas
2399	6	A	uh-huh.
2399	7	B	that, uh, often it would, uh, it would expedite things to have an american express credit card
2399	6	A	oh really.
2399	7	B	for hotel bills and so forth.
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	4	B	plus i would, uh, when they, uh, would send the bill, they would automatically convert to the exchange rate.
2399	6	A	right,
2399	6	A	right.
2399	4	B	so, now, the only time that got to be a problem was, if the exchange rate changed drastically.
2399	6	A	uh-huh.
2399	4	B	uh, for example, i remember on one trip to france when i started planning the trip, i think, uh, a dollar was worth nine or ten
2399	4	B	francs -- * this looks like funny parsing to me. shouldn't "francs" be part of previous utt, and b.64, with it's coordinating conjunction and indep clause, start a new slash unit?
2399	6	A	uh-huh.
2399	7	B	and just in a matter of a week or two the dollar fell against the franc, drastically. / * see note on b.62 utt2 above
2399	4	B	and whe-, when i finally got over there, it had fallen, uh, two or three francs to the dollar.
2399	5	B	so the ,
2399	9	A	wow .
2399	4	B	so, i got caught a little short
2399	9	A	wow.
2399	7	B	in that regard,
2399	4	B	but, uh
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	7	B	uh, i, i was anticipating, you know, my room would cost, uh, let's say
2399	4	B	if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night
2399	6	A	right.
2399	7	B	that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so, or maybe twenty dolls-,
2399	4	B	maybe it would be more than that.
2399	4	B	it was more than.
2399	4	B	it would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night
2399	6	A	right.
2399	7	B	which is a reasonable rate.
2399	6	A	right.
2399	4	B	but then when i got back and i was working for the government at the time --
2399	6	A	uh-huh.
2399	4	B	of course the government was several months behind  in,
2399	6	A	right,
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	7	B	their,  on its  per diem for exchange rate.
2399	6	A	right.
2399	4	B	so there's a little consternation, you know, in trying to get them to compensate,
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	7	B	for the difference in the exchange rate.
2399	3	A	right.
2399	3	A	yeah
2399	5	A	especially,
2399	4	B	that was the only time i really got caught short.
2399	4	B	and i,
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	7	B	but as i  said, most, most of all i try not to use them, uh, to any, you know, lavishly, in that regard.
2399	6	A	yeah,
2399	9	A	well tha-, that's good.
2399	20	B	well, from where are you calling?
2399	4	A	oh, from the dallas area.
2399	29	B	so you're from dal-,
2399	14	B	okay,
2399	4	B	i'm from maryland.
2399	18	A	oh really.
2399	19	B	yeah .
2399	9	A	wow.
2399	13	A	do you work for t i?
2399	26	B	no.
2399	4	B	i work for g t e.
2399	18	A	well, really.
2399	19	B	yes.
2399	13	A	um. i wonder how t i got g t e involved.
2399	4	B	well, i know jack godfrey.
2399	14	A	oh, okay.
2399	4	B	i know him very well.
2399	4	B	i've known jack for a long time,
2399	4	B	and i'm also in the speech business.
2399	14	A	oh, okay.
2399	4	B	so, when i heard that jack was going to do this, i called him and asked for an application where i could participate
2399	6	A	yeah,
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	7	B	in this.
2399	4	B	and, so that's how i got involved.
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	2	A	you have a very, um, very,
2399	22	A	what's the word.
2399	2	A	your, your speech is very exact.
2399	38	B	oh. thank you very much .
2399	4	B	but, as jack said, i'm one of the, the old hands in the speech business.
2399	18	A	oh really.
2399	19	B	yeah,
2399	19	B	uh. yes,
2399	4	B	i, i've been doing it for twenty some odd years.
2399	9	A	wow.
2399	4	B	and so, uh, i was very much interested, uh, in getting involved in, uh, switchboard.
2399	6	A	yeah.
2399	13	B	so, uh, you work for t i?
2399	23	A	right.
2399	4	A	i work in .
2399	18	B	oh, really?
2399	19	A	yeah.
2399	4	B	i guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording .
2399	3	A	yeah .
2399	4	A	i think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject,
2399	4	A	so, i think you get ten,
2399	2	A	so i think we're okay.
2399	3	B	alright.
2399	3	B	okay,
2399	3	B	fine.
2399	12	B	well, you have a good evening.
2399	12	A	well, you too.
2399	12	B	it's been pleasant talking to you.
2399	12	A	same here.
2399	12	B	take care.
2399	12	B	good night.
2399	12	A	bye.
2455	4	A	well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type .
2455	13	B	have you been talking to males?
2455	5	B	yeah,
2455	5	B	yeah,
2455	2	B	this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female .
2455	4	A	i was afraid we might get into an argument.
2455	3	B	right.
2455	2	A	well, uh, i guess uh, there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations,
2455	6	B	uh-huh.
2455	7	A	for, uh, the roles of women
2455	2	A	and uh, i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now,
2455	6	B	right.
2455	7	A	and trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities, you know,
2455	2	A	they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things.
2455	6	B	yeah,
2455	2	B	it, it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore, the women are spreading themselves thinner,
2455	3	A	oh, i think so.
2455	7	B	than before.
2455	3	A	absolutely.
2455	2	A	i, i, i think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days.
2455	6	B	uh-huh.
2455	4	A	sometimes, i think i am going crazy trying to do it
2455	5	A	but,
2455	13	B	do you work outside the home?
2455	19	A	yes.
2455	13	B	do you have children?
2455	19	A	uh, yes.
2455	4	A	they are getting older now,
2455	6	B	uh-huh.
2455	4	A	so they are not quite as much of a responsibility
2455	4	A	but they are still there, you know,
2455	9	B	oh sure.
2455	4	A	they still take time,
2455	4	A	and, and i, you know, i still provide most of the things that go on around the house.
2455	6	B	right.
2455	5	A	so, uh, yeah
2455	4	A	and for a while i was going to school too,
2455	4	A	and tha-, it was tough.
2455	6	B	yeah,
2455	2	B	i uh, i think that while it's a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel, you know,
2455	6	A	uh-huh.
2455	7	B	their expertise may be.
2455	6	A	uh-huh.
2455	4	B	uh, i think sometimes other things suffer and tha-,
2455	2	B	i think it's hard to find a balance there.
2455	2	A	but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all.
2455	2	A	you're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things
2455	2	A	and
2455	6	B	right.
2455	7	A	that's where the problem is really.
2455	6	B	yeah,
2455	6	B	yeah,
2455	4	B	i have little children, four and one,
2455	4	B	and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home.
2455	6	A	uh-huh.
2455	5	B	uh, and when i, i, i happen to, you know be,
2455	4	B	i'm very active with, uh, people, other people with children my age
2455	2	B	and most of us do tend to stay home,
2455	4	B	but when i run into people that, you know, just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time, i, there's almost a, uh, friction between us.
2455	6	A	uh-huh.
2455	6	B	uh-huh,
2455	4	B	not people that are, you know, necessarily good friends,
2455	6	A	yeah.
2455	7	B	even though that has happened too, uh,
2455	2	B	it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence.
2455	5	B	you know w-,
2455	2	B	if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself.
2455	6	A	right.
2455	2	B	and if you don't then, sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time ,
2455	6	A	yeah.
2455	7	B	at home.
2455	3	A	yeah,
2455	4	A	it's a tough one.
2455	4	A	i mean, i've done some of both.
2455	6	B	uh-huh.
2455	4	A	i, when my kids were real little, i was at home for a couple of different periods of time.
2455	6	B	uh-huh.
2455	4	A	oh, i think the longest was less than a year,
2455	4	A	but still at least i was able to, to spend, you know, those first months with them.
2455	6	B	right.
2455	4	A	but, uh, i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things.
2455	6	B	yeah.
2455	4	A	you know, the money was the issue.
2455	16	B	<Laughter>.
2455	4	A	but, uh, even now, i would, i would like to not have to work in some ways.
2455	6	B	right.
2455	4	A	it, it's kind of pull and tug,
2455	6	B	yeah.
2455	4	A	on the other hand, i can't imagine just being at home, uh, although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue.
2455	6	B	uh-huh.
2455	2	A	uh, still, uh, there's, there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having, you know, a job and all that goes with that.
2455	3	B	no,
2455	3	B	that, that's definitely true.
2455	4	B	in fact, i, i work out of my home.
2455	4	B	um, i'm an accountant,
2455	6	A	oh.
2455	4	B	and i do taxes and bookkeeping
2455	5	B	and i, uh,
2455	5	B	it was,
2455	4	B	it's a way for me to stay home.
2455	6	A	uh-huh.
2455	4	B	and i mean, i still, unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night,
2455	6	A	yeah.
2455	4	B	but, uh, but it, it's worked out for, for my family,
2455	6	A	yeah.
2455	7	B	to have my cake and eat it too, kind of thing.
2455	6	A	yeah,
2455	9	A	that's a good deal.
2455	1	A	where do you think this is going in the future,
2455	13	A	i mean, do you think things are going to change,
2455	13	A	or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this?
2455	27	B	well, i, i hope that they will change uh,
2455	5	B	but, but i'm,
2455	5	B	i just,
2455	2	B	i know it's going to be a slow change.
2455	2	B	uh, i, i feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner.
2455	4	B	i mean i'm just thinking of my circle of people that i know.
2455	4	B	i know quite a few people who have decided to not have both, both, both, uh, couples, you know, both, uh, of the parents work.
2455	6	A	yeah.
2455	5	B	and yet, uh, i, i we-,
2455	4	B	i hope to see employer based, you know, helping out.
2455	6	A	uh-huh.
2455	7	B	you know, child, uh, care centers at the place of employment and, and things like that, that will help out.
2455	1	B	what do you think,
2455	13	B	do you think we are,
2455	4	A	i don't,
2455	7	B	setting a trend?
2455	19	A	yeah,
2455	4	A	i, well i see, i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children.
2455	6	B	uh-huh.
2455	2	A	uh, and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the, the family things work.
2455	6	B	right.
2455	2	A	uh, but i don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers, you know.
2455	2	A	it's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are,
2455	2	A	i don't know if they want to completely give that up.
2455	3	B	right,
2455	2	B	it's a very personal thing.
2455	2	A	but, it would be nice if there could be an in-between, a middle ground somewhere.
2455	6	B	yeah.
2455	4	B	i think it's hard though when you talk about, about families and, and raising children
2455	2	B	because ch-, i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground.
2455	2	B	i think they, uh, they need security
2455	5	B	and yet they,
2455	28	B	i don't know,
2455	5	B	i,
2455	4	B	from speaking from my children, the-, they aren't real flexible when it comes to things like that.
2455	6	A	yeah.
2455	2	B	they, uh, they want to know things are going to be a certain way.
2455	3	A	well, yeah,
2455	2	A	i think they, they like a routine of sorts.
2455	6	B	uh-huh,
2455	3	B	right.
2455	28	B	well, we will see.
2455	4	B	i, i'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society.
2455	3	A	well, yes,
2455	4	A	i, i like the fact that, you know, gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions,
2455	2	A	but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be.
2455	3	B	oh, yes,
2455	2	B	the, the numbers are still very skewed to say the least.
2455	6	A	yeah.
2455	5	A	okay,
2455	12	A	well i enjoyed talking to you.
2455	12	B	okay,
2455	12	B	you too ellen.
2455	12	A	all right, #
2455	12	A	good-bye. #
2455	12	B	# bye-bye. #
2501	0	A	okay,
2501	4	A	we're energized.
2501	6	B	okay.
2501	4	A	um, painting,
2501	4	A	interesting.
2501	4	A	uh, the guy called me,
2501	4	A	when she called me, the computer called me, i thought that they were reading my mind.
2501	4	A	i'm in the middle of, um, going out for bids to have my house painted.
2501	6	B	oh.
2501	4	A	uh, painting is not hard to do, uh,
2501	3	B	no.
2501	7	A	as long as it's not in, not to the point of where it 's, uh, needs to be scraped and bl-, peeling,
2501	6	B	right.
2501	4	A	and our house is not
2501	4	A	but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap
2501	4	A	and it's just a hassle to go through it
2501	4	A	so i'm looking for the easy way out.
2501	3	B	yeah,
2501	3	B	uh, i know.
2501	5	B	di-,
2501	13	B	is easy to find pa-, uh, painters to do this for you?
2501	27	A	it's easier to find painters,
2501	4	A	but you have to be, you have to be aware of what, uh, how messy they can get and are they going to put on a good, a good two coats, and are they,
2501	5	B	ri-,
2501	13	B	are you talking,
2501	7	A	going to caulk,
2501	7	B	outside or inside?
2501	4	A	exterior.
2501	30	B	exterior,
2501	6	B	yeah.
2501	6	A	yeah.
2501	2	A	uh, interior's not so bad because it's more fun,
2501	5	A	it's more, c-,
2501	5	A	but yeah,
2501	6	B	yeah.
2501	4	A	outside you have high peeks,
2501	6	B	yeah.
2501	7	A	and those kind of things,
2501	2	A	it can be a real issue.
2501	4	B	well, when we've painted, um,
2501	4	B	right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there,
2501	4	B	it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles,
2501	6	A	uh-huh.
2501	7	B	on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front
2501	4	B	so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted.
2501	5	B	um, but, i-, it,
2501	4	B	the problem is that it hits, the sun hits it.
2501	4	B	so preparing is a real problem,
2501	6	A	uh-huh.
2501	4	B	you've got to prepare it well
2501	4	B	or else it will flake.
2501	6	A	uh-huh.
2501	5	B	um,
2501	5	A	here they,
2501	4	A	some of the home builders are,
2501	4	A	they don't put brick on the side of your house just to save money
2501	4	A	so they put up, uh, a quarter inch masonite, basically,
2501	4	A	and they painted it kind of like a spun of a sorts
2501	4	A	so it's real cheap.
2501	4	A	and, uh, uh, i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and i, as low as five hundred and forty dollars
2501	5	A	so it's,
2501	9	B	wow.
2501	7	A	just a matter of,
2501	5	A	it's,
2501	7	B	that's quite a range.
2501	4	A	oh, there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap
2501	4	A	and i'm so much worried about that as what,
2501	6	B	yeah.
2501	7	A	i don't want it all over the brick and windows
2501	5	A	and,
2501	3	B	yeah,
2501	2	B	which might be a bigger problem than it would be, uh,
2501	9	A	oh, sure.
2501	3	B	yeah,
2501	3	B	absolutely .
2501	13	A	so y'all, you haven't had any, any jobs painted in your house or recently .
2501	26	B	no,
2501	4	B	we 've have, uh, done a little painting ourselves, um,
2501	4	B	we painted the bedroom, uh, well within the last t-, couple of months,
2501	9	A	that's fun.
2501	4	B	and we have, we have some more that need to be done,
2501	6	A	uh-huh.
2501	4	B	but the, the problem that we've, we've owned this house almost five years now,
2501	4	B	and, um, when we bought it the, um, it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired,
2501	4	B	but the daughter was a real estate agent
2501	4	B	and she was selling it
2501	4	B	and it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house.
2501	4	B	so she told us that the house had been, uh, professionally painted recently.
2501	4	B	and it looked pretty good, you know, the, uh, the interior walls all basically white,
2501	4	B	but they obviously had been done without to much, uh, wear afterward.
2501	4	B	the only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood-, uh, the door frames,
2501	6	A	uh-huh.
2501	4	B	when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it.
2501	9	A	uh, that's not very,
2501	4	B	big long strips.
2501	4	B	so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly.
2501	4	B	and some of still has to be redone.
2501	29	A	oh, they just painted over varnished wood.
2501	3	B	yeah,
2501	9	A	oh, my,
2501	31	B	well, no
2501	4	B	actually it had been, uh, it would have been, it had been a repaint job.
2501	6	A	um.
2501	4	B	but they had not,
2501	4	B	either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top
2501	4	B	or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they,
2501	4	B	because it was woodwork
2501	4	B	so it looked as if it had been painted,
2501	6	A	uh-huh.
2501	7	B	correctly with, you know, uh, an enamel or something,
2501	4	B	but, um, it had not,
2501	4	B	either that or it had not been prepared underneath
2501	4	B	and it was greasy or something,
2501	6	A	sure.
2501	4	B	it comes off in strips, i mean not even little bit.
2501	4	B	so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time,
2501	9	A	oh, no.
2501	4	B	we know what a job it's going to be
2501	4	B	because you almost have to strip the whole thing,
2501	6	A	um.
2501	7	B	in order to do it again.
2501	12	A	i wish you good luck.
2501	12	B	okay .
2501	12	A	thank you very much.
2501	12	B	thank you.
2501	12	A	bye-bye.
2501	12	B	bye.
2534	20	A	so, what kind of neat hobbies do you have?
2534	4	B	well, i like gardening a lot,
2534	4	B	i like to be outside, um.
2534	4	A	i like gardening,
2534	4	A	i wish i had a green thumb, though.
2534	16	B	<Laughter>.
2534	4	A	i've got a brown thumb.
2534	4	A	that's what everything turns.
2534	5	B	oh , is,
2534	13	B	but, do you tr-, keep trying anyway?
2534	23	A	i keep trying, uh, you know,
2534	2	A	you just can't, can't give up on it, uh,
2534	4	A	i,  uh, i bought some, uh, plants from michigan bulb company
2534	4	A	they send them to you all ready alive.
2534	26	B	no,
2534	26	B	no,
2534	4	B	i've never had any luck with their's.
2534	6	A	oh really.
2534	19	B	right.
2534	2	A	i guess, i guess these are going to croak too.
2534	16	B	<Laughter>.
2534	4	A	since i've got cats, i decided to get some catnip.
2534	6	B	oh.
2534	4	A	lots and lots of catnip,
2534	4	A	so it's, it's still green,
2534	4	A	and it's been two days
2534	4	A	so i'm encouraged .
2534	26	B	no,
2534	4	B	i, i haven't had, had good luck with that company, uh,
2534	2	B	i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail, probably.
2534	6	A	yeah.
2534	4	B	but, i've had to, to get my money back from them and had better luck with, with some of the, the more expensive companies.
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	5	A	there's a, uh,
2534	5	B	because they,
2534	28	A	i don't know,
2534	13	A	do you have lowe's up there?
2534	5	B	uh, well,
2534	5	A	its, uh,
2534	5	A	building, uh, contra-,
2534	15	A	or building supplies place.
2534	26	B	no.
2534	4	A	um, they, they also have a garden shop
2534	0	A	and,
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	7	A	they, they offer just as good a guarantee, if you buy it from them.
2534	9	B	oh, that's great,
2534	6	A	yeah.
2534	4	B	now our local stores don't, don't offer any guarantee.
2534	6	A	um.
2534	4	B	but some of the,
2534	4	B	the mail order ones that i've dealt with for roses and that, they offer through, through the first summer.
2534	6	A	yeah.
2534	7	B	which at least if they, if they take off the first year, they're probably going to come up unless there's, uh, a terrible freeze or something.
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	4	A	something like that.
2534	4	A	uh, i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff,
2534	4	A	so, i'm going to wait on those.
2534	13	B	oh, they're bulbs for spring or fall?
2534	4	A	uh, probably spring,
2534	4	A	but, uh, i don't much care about things like that.
2534	4	A	i'll, i'll make a little sort of greenhouse, a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in.
2534	16	B	<Laughter>.
2534	4	A	something, something, to keep me occupied, you see.
2534	6	B	uh-huh,
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	4	A	i'll, uh, buy some plastic and make a little house
2534	5	A	and,
2534	9	B	cute.
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	4	A	and watch the cats tear it up.
2534	6	B	right.
2534	4	B	i don't know that,
2534	13	B	do cats bother bulbs?
2534	2	B	i think more the mice or other rodents.
2534	23	A	they, they just like to get in and dig.
2534	14	B	oh, i see
2534	29	B	so if you have fresh dirt, they'll ,
2534	4	A	oh, they love to dig.
2534	4	A	i had, i had some, uh,
2534	4	A	i don't know what kind they are,
2534	4	A	i've already forgotten,
2534	4	A	just regular old flower seeds
2534	4	A	and i planted them
2534	4	A	and i was so, i was so thrilled because they came up, i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place.
2534	4	A	and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that.
2534	9	B	uh, gee.
2534	4	A	so, i have to hang these things high,
2534	4	A	so they can't get to them.
2534	4	A	especially the catnip.
2534	20	B	how many cats do you have?
2534	4	A	three.
2534	14	B	oh okay.
2534	16	A	<Laughter>.
2534	4	B	actually i just, put a, uh, little fence around my yard, uh, um, which is i suppose, technically illegal,
2534	4	B	but i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they'll let me get by with it,
2534	4	B	and it, it's got this one inch mesh
2534	4	B	and what i've noticed it's kept the cats out
2534	4	B	and i love it .
2534	6	A	um, yeah,
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	4	A	because they, they like to get in and fertilize things too.
2534	20	A	but, uh, why would it be illegal?
2534	4	B	well, because we have these tow-, uh,
2534	4	B	i live in a townhouse
2534	4	B	and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission.
2534	6	A	oh, uh, yeah,
2534	6	A	right.
2534	2	B	and, you know, they want, uh, privacy fences.
2534	2	A	well, if nobody, yeah, if nobody complains you're all right.
2534	6	B	right,
2534	6	B	right.
2534	4	B	well they do walking tours too,
2534	5	B	so.
2534	6	A	um.
2534	2	B	but at least, because i back up to, um, a hillside where the, uh, wild animals are, i think i can probably justify it.
2534	6	A	um, yeah,
2534	5	A	an,
2534	2	A	and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway.
2534	6	B	right,
2534	6	B	right,
2534	5	B	i me-,
2534	2	A	you know, you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property.
2534	6	B	right,
2534	4	B	the first year, the deer ate my garden,
2534	4	B	and i was just astounded.
2534	4	B	i'm going deer, right here in the city .
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	30	A	right here, bambi .
2534	3	B	exactly.
2534	9	A	uh, gosh.
2534	5	B	and so,
2534	21	A	well, let's see,
2534	4	A	other than gardening which i fiddle at,
2534	4	A	i'm not very good at,
2534	22	A	what else do i, mostly just computer stuff.
2534	6	B	oh.
2534	4	A	i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that.
2534	4	A	uh, cooking, that's not really a hobby,
2534	2	A	it's a necessity.
2534	16	B	<Laughter>.
2534	4	A	but, but i enjoy it.
2534	4	A	i like to think that i'm a very good cook.
2534	9	B	oh, great.
2534	21	A	um, hobbies,
2534	4	A	that's about it.
2534	4	A	i don't have much time for hobbies, uh, between being a student and trying to run a business on the side,
2534	2	A	you don't have a lot of time.
2534	3	B	right
2534	4	B	that keeps you busy.
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	4	A	and raising cats.
2534	4	B	i mean that could become a hobby.
2534	4	A	well, it's, it started out as a hobby actually.
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	4	A	uh, it just, it developed into sort of a business, uh, you know,
2534	4	A	we breed them and all that,
2534	4	A	but, we didn't, you know, we didn't really start it for the money,
2534	5	A	it was just,
2534	4	A	they were fun to have around
2534	4	A	and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds an.
2534	4	A	and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them, and, you know, all this kind of stuff.
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	20	B	what kind of cats are they?
2534	4	A	uh, i've got a, uh, a bombay, a turkish van and a himalayan persian.
2534	9	B	wow.
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	4	A	the himie is probably the sweetest one.
2534	4	A	she's, she's just a little sweetheart.
2534	16	B	<Laughter>.
2534	5	A	we, uh,
2534	4	A	the, the bombay had a litter, uh, last october
2534	5	A	and w-,
2534	4	A	i just got her back from the vet this morning, getting her spayed.
2534	4	A	only going to breed them once.
2534	6	B	oh, okay.
2534	4	A	and, uh, she's not, she's not feeling too great today.
2534	13	B	um, is that typical, to only breed them once?
2534	26	A	no,
2534	2	A	uh, m-, most breeders are in it for the money,
2534	4	A	so they'll bree-, they'll breed them twice a year
2534	2	A	and  i,
2534	6	B	uh-huh,
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	7	A	i  just think that it's kind of, i don't know, it's kind of cruel.
2534	2	A	you know, they just, they just breed these, they breed them before they're ready,
2534	2	A	uh, and,
2534	6	B	right.
2534	7	A	you're never, you're never rea-,
2534	2	A	and, and they, they do a lot of inbreeding too,
2534	2	A	and so you end up with, you know, kind of strange kittens.
2534	6	B	uh-huh,
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	4	A	and i just don't like that.
2534	13	B	so will, you, uh, breed one of the litter, then next year?
2534	36	A	we're, we sold all that litter,
2534	6	B	oh.
2534	5	A	um, we,
2534	4	A	there's not that much call to, for bombays.
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	4	A	um, they're, they're registered
2534	4	A	but they're not, they're not, uh, they're not show cats.
2534	6	B	oh, i see.
2534	4	A	uh, so all you can do is sell them as pet quality.
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	4	A	uh, so what you've got is a registered pet.
2534	2	A	and, not too many people want bombays.
2534	2	A	they want things like himie persians and turkish vans.
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	2	A	turkish vans, if you've never seen one, i mean, you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred.
2534	4	A	it's just, uh, medium size short hair cat.
2534	5	A	it's got,
2534	4	A	he's mostly white with, uh, brown and black patches.
2534	6	B	oh.
2534	4	A	but they have nice personalities
2534	4	A	and they're very inquisitive.
2534	4	A	um, now the himie, we'll probably breed her a couple of times
2534	4	A	and we'll, we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those.
2534	6	B	right.
2534	4	A	it's just the stud fees are so much, though.
2534	4	A	it'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her.
2534	4	A	we, we want to breed her with a champion,
2534	5	A	so.
2534	6	B	right.
2534	13	B	now these are long haired?
2534	19	A	yeah,
2534	4	A	the persian is,
2534	6	B	uh-huh,
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	4	A	and the other two are short hairs.
2534	6	B	right.
2534	9	B	uh, that's nice.
2534	6	A	yeah,
2534	4	A	she's, uh, she's sweet.
2534	4	A	going to have some nice kittens, i hope.
2534	6	B	uh-huh
2534	16	B	<laughter>.
2534	5	A	she's, uh, she's,
2534	4	A	if yo-, if you know what a himalayan is, generally they look something like, uh,
2534	4	A	well they come in a lot of different colors.
2534	2	A	people don't realize it
2534	2	A	but they're sort of like, uh, siamese in a way.
2534	4	A	they have the, uh, they have the gloves on the paws
2534	4	A	and they're, they're usually two colored.
2534	5	A	uh, but this one is, uh, is
2534	4	A	she's, pre-, predominantly, uh, black
2534	4	A	but she has chocolate, uh, paws, chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters.
2534	9	B	gee.
2534	6	A	and yeah,
2534	4	A	she's, she's quite attractive looking.
2534	6	B	uh-huh,
2534	6	B	uh-huh.
2534	4	A	hope, hope the stud will find her attractive.
2534	4	B	and that she has kittens that look like her.
2534	4	A	and, and that she has a whole bunch of kittens.
2534	4	A	but we have to be careful,
2534	4	A	uh, you know, we have to get a particular color point, uh, stud.
2534	2	A	you can't just breed them with anything.
2534	4	A	we have to get a, uh, we have to get a silver point himie,
2534	4	A	so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens.
2534	6	B	i see.
2534	4	A	that's,  it, that's  the fun part, trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with,
2534	4	A	can't just go out there and say, okay, you guys breed, you know .
2534	2	B	you can't just tell them that anyway,
2534	5	B	but .
2534	3	A	that's right.
2534	9	B	oh dear.
2534	2	B	well it really sounds like, uh, uh, a business more than a hobby.
2534	3	A	well actually, i mean, it, it is a business in a way,
2534	4	A	but it, it's a lot of fun as a hobby. especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats.
2534	4	A	we're, we're about to get another breed,
2534	4	A	we're go-, we're going to buy a devon rex .
2534	4	A	and i didn't, i don't like devon rexes at first.
2534	20	B	what is it.
2534	4	A	it's a, well actually it's a mutant.
2534	4	A	it, it comes from england and, uh, fr-, in the county of devon.
2534	6	B	oh.
2534	4	A	and it's a mutant cat.
2534	4	A	and they're, they're pretty expensive,
2534	4	A	we're going to, we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one.
2534	4	A	um, they're very thin,
2534	4	A	they're, they're, they're long and lanky and skinny.
2534	6	B	um.
2534	4	A	and they have real short hair.
2534	4	A	it's curly, as a matter of fact.
2534	9	B	huh, interesting.
2534	6	A	um, yeah,
2534	4	A	it, it, it's a strange looking cat.
2534	4	A	uh, i didn't like them at first.
2534	4	A	they've got great big ears,
2558	1	A	what do you think about the, uh, peace corps or public service commitment?
2558	4	B	uh, that's the first i've ever heard of it.
2558	4	B	i haven't heard of it, anything too much about it.
2558	5	B	um,
2558	4	A	well, i think it was, uh, thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft
2558	4	A	and people said, well, they, uh, young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country,
2558	2	A	but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from, um, some sort of public service,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	like the conservation corps back in the thirties or, uh, various other things of that sort.
2558	2	A	and it seems to me that it's, it's not a totally bad idea,
2558	4	A	but i don't quite see how they'd make it work.
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	8	A	how would they decide who goes into, uh, building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who goes to saudi arabia?
2558	3	B	right,
2558	3	B	yeah.
2558	5	B	i,
2558	5	B	the,
2558	4	B	my first impression was, um, it would be v-, very good.
2558	2	B	i think it would be good for people to serve,
2558	4	B	but i don't know if it should be an option.
2558	2	B	it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids.
2558	4	B	and i think there are some available now where they are able to work,
2558	2	B	but making it a mandatory thing kind of,
2558	3	A	yeah,
2558	2	A	the, the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary.
2558	6	B	right.
2558	4	A	and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary, that it should be like a draft.
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	4	A	and some people would get military service
2558	4	A	and some people would get civilian, uh,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	service, like working in hospitals.
2558	5	A	this,
2558	2	A	i assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do,
2558	7	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the army,
2558	4	A	they were allowed to do hospital service or, uh, things like that,
2558	5	A	and if they re-,
2558	4	A	or farm work in world war one i remember
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	uh, reading about.
2558	2	A	and, and i suppose that there is, uh, justification for taking everybody if you take anybody.
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	2	A	but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them, uh, sorting them out, assigning them,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	training them would be insurmountable.
2558	2	B	it seems like you'd have a lot more conscie-, conscientious objectors if they had that choice.
2558	3	A	yeah,
2558	3	A	well it's a possibility.
2558	6	B	yeah,
2558	4	B	you know, i'd, i'd much rather work in a hospital than, than to go war
2558	2	B	and i'm sure most young men and women would.
2558	5	B	and so, uh,
2558	4	A	well, i think that in the, in the cases that, like that, uh, they had to be, uh, pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war.
2558	4	A	it was, uh, something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life.
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	9	B	well, that makes sense.
2558	2	B	and then you run into, again, to, um, the bureaucracy in running it.
2558	8	B	you know, how you going to
2558	6	A	oh, yeah.
2558	7	B	cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then
2558	3	A	sure,
2558	2	A	and,
2558	5	B	so,
2558	7	A	in addition to that, we have the cost because you have to pay something for,
2558	6	B	right.
2558	7	A	their room and board
2558	2	A	and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	uh, even if it's like the peace corps where they don't get most of it until they come home,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	you have t-, have to pay them something.
2558	2	B	plus the training involved.
2558	6	A	oh, yeah.
2558	30	B	yeah,
2558	2	B	that would be expensive in most cases.
2558	6	A	yeah,
2558	5	B	because ,
2558	4	A	now i had a lot of friends who went to the peace corps, uh, back in the mid sixties
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	4	A	and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization,
2558	4	A	but on the other hand, i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was.
2558	4	A	i don't,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	know what we got for all the money.
2558	2	A	we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to, uh, what was then east pakistan is now bangladesh,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	and to, uh, algeria and to, uh, southeast asia and lots of, uh, out-of-the-way places.
2558	4	A	but i don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better.
2558	5	B	well, i know in,
2558	4	B	i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught christianity in japan.
2558	6	A	uh-huh.
2558	4	B	and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me.
2558	4	B	it taught me not to be so self-centered and it, you know, to think of others.
2558	6	A	uh-huh.
2558	4	B	but i don't know if i was doing it in different situation, you know, not a really religious background, if, if i would get a lot out of it.
2558	2	B	you know, i think i did because it, you know, it emphasized that sort of thing.
2558	4	B	you know, a lot of
2558	6	A	sure.
2558	7	B	self evaluation.
2558	4	A	and it was definitely voluntary, too.
2558	4	A	they were not drafting you and sending you,
2558	6	B	right.
2558	7	A	against your will.
2558	6	B	right.
2558	2	B	and that, i'm sure that would make a big difference, too.
2558	5	B	you know, you've got ,
2558	3	A	yeah.
2558	1	A	well, what about a voluntary program?
2558	13	A	do you think that would be a good idea?
2558	4	B	um, well, like i say, i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth, like teenagers to go and do, um, work in the national parks and work in, uh, neighborhoods to do, um, clean up and that sort of thing.
2558	4	B	but i don't know what organization it's under.
2558	4	B	i don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private
2558	4	A	i don't either.
2558	7	B	charity that's put it together.
2558	2	B	but i know that that helps a lot with training and, um
2558	3	A	yeah,
2558	4	A	out here in california,
2558	7	B	a lot of,
2558	7	A	there's a program like that for, uh, juvenile delinquents, the, the ones that are not dangerous
2558	4	A	and they don't have to be locked up go to these, uh, camps.
2558	4	A	and they,
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	7	A	do forestry work.
2558	4	A	they maintain trails
2558	4	A	and they, uh, put up signs
2558	4	A	and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort.
2558	6	B	uh-huh.
2558	4	A	and that i know is run by the state,
2558	4	A	but there may be other things.
2558	4	A	i'm not so sure what kind of, uh, training that is for the future for those kids.
2558	6	B	yeah,
2558	8	B	how much benefit,
2558	2	A	it's probably  a,
2558	7	B	it'll do them in the long run?
2558	7	A	a  very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble,
2558	2	A	but whether it's something that they can put to, to economic use later on is a different subject.
2558	3	B	right,
2558	2	B	especially in, you know, if you take a, a child that's from the inner city and then put them in the, a middle of a park,
2558	2	B	if they go back to the inner city, they may not see trees for a while,
2558	3	A	that's true .
2558	7	B	much less be able to take care of them .
2558	9	A	good point , oh.
2558	2	B	so that's, yeah, so that may not, may not benefit them in the long run.
2558	6	A	yeah.
2558	5	B	but,
2558	6	A	yeah,
2558	10	A	i'm sorry,
2558	12	A	i'm going to have to go,
2558	12	A	but my other line is blinking.
2558	12	B	okay,
2558	12	B	well, thank you.
2558	12	A	but it was good to talk to you.
2558	12	B	you, too,
2558	12	B	bye-bye.
2593	4	A	so, the, the topic is hobbies .
2593	24	B	in your spare time.
2593	6	A	yeah.
2593	8	A	who has spare time ?
2593	16	B	<Laughter>.
2593	4	A	um, i don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that.
2593	4	A	i used to. i used to do, like salt ornaments and things.
2593	6	B	uh-huh.
2593	4	A	but that was, oh, good many, many years ago
2593	5	A	and
2593	6	B	yeah.
2593	7	A	i have, i really, my spare time
2593	4	A	i usually go do aerobics and read,
2593	4	A	and that's,
2593	6	B	# yeah. #
2593	7	A	# about # it .
2593	6	B	yeah.
2593	4	B	i understood that.
2593	4	B	i'm, you know, i work full time
2593	4	B	and i have two kids
2593	4	B	so my spare time usually involves something with the kids.
2593	6	A	yeah.
2593	5	B	you know, hobbies,
2593	4	B	we, i, i can't really say that we have hobbies.
2593	4	B	it's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.
2593	4	B	you know, we like to  go out  ,
2593	6	A	# yeah, #
2593	7	B	# go # out,
2593	5	A	family.
2593	4	A	well, well, that's what i meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and,
2593	6	B	oh.
2593	6	B	uh-huh.
2593	7	A	things like that, and just kind of really got into it. like during the christmas season,
2593	6	B	right.
2593	7	A	making them up for other people and things like that.
2593	5	A	but
2593	6	B	uh-huh.
2593	7	A	as far as,
2593	4	A	i've just never been very skilled at,
2593	16	B	# . #
2593	7	A	# far, you # know, needle,
2593	6	B	uh-huh.
2593	7	A	work cloths.
2593	4	A	and the things i've tried to do just don't look very good ,
2593	16	B	<Laughter>.
2593	5	A	and,
2593	4	B	i, i guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, i've done, um, some needlepoint.
2593	4	B	i've done mostly cross stitching.
2593	4	B	i used to, uh, do like, um,
2593	4	B	one that i did for both kids are like, oh,
2593	4	B	they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals
2593	4	B	and then you have their birth date on them,
2593	6	A	yeah.
2593	4	B	and then you have a little picture of them
2593	4	B	and you frame them and stuff,
2593	6	A	uh-huh.
2593	4	B	but nothing steady.
2593	4	B	just when i get some spare time here and there i'll work on it,
2593	4	B	but, you know, it's nothing that i,
2593	29	A	it's not,
2593	7	B	can really,
2593	7	A	like you sit and knit every night .
2593	3	B	no.
2593	3	B	not at all.
2593	6	A	yeah.
2593	4	A	i don't even know how to knit
2593	4	A	and my mother used to knit, you know,
2593	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2593	7	A	# all # the time
2593	4	A	and, and i don't even know how to knit ,
2593	16	B	<Laughter>.
2593	4	A	i'm like, that's a lost art from this family .
2593	6	B	yeah.
2593	5	A	so, um,
2593	2	A	but, it's not a very good topic
2593	28	A	it feels like,
2593	3	B	# no. #
2593	7	A	# if, # you know,
2593	5	A	not when you're n-,
2593	4	A	neither one of us are really,
2593	4	A	i, i have seen things i really like,
2593	6	B	uh-huh.
2593	7	A	you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint.
2593	4	A	needlepoint,
2593	6	B	yeah.
2593	7	A	cushions and things.
2593	2	A	but, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it,
2593	6	B	yeah.
2593	7	A	you know, and, and that the petty point and things like that.
2593	2	A	it's like, god,  it, it seems like  it's easier just to go out and buy it already # made . #
2593	4	B	# # i don't know what, what, is,
2593	4	B	it's like there,
2593	4	B	but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling.
2593	6	A	yeah.
2593	4	B	and, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff
2593	4	B	and there's just tons of stuff everywhere
2593	4	B	and,
2593	6	A	# yeah. #
2593	7	B	# you # know, people just do it in their garage
2593	4	B	and then on weekends they go out and sell it
2593	4	B	and during the week they go back and do some more.
2593	29	A	and see, they do that as their job. whereas,
2593	3	B	# right . #
2593	7	A	# you know, # for us it,
2593	4	A	and they make it cheaper for us to buy .
2593	3	B	yeah .
2593	3	B	definitely.
2593	5	A	so,
2593	2	A	but, and, i mean, i'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that
2593	4	A	because i can remember when i used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things.
2593	2	A	it was, it was relaxing, you know, creative,
2593	2	A	you felt very creative.
2593	6	B	uh-huh.
2593	4	A	but, it just was so  time, time,
2593	6	B	# yeah. #
2593	7	A	# involved,  # you know, so much time involved  and the different steps and things.
2593	6	B	uh-huh.
2593	5	A	so, #
2593	5	A	and, #
2593	6	B	# okay # .
2593	2	B	well, i think, i think we're okay.
2593	2	B	i think we did the five minutes,
2593	4	B	so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore .
2593	6	A	yeah.
2593	5	A	# so, #
2593	6	B	# okay. #
2593	38	B	well, thank you.
2593	40	A	okay.
2593	4	A	i hope you have a good rest of your weekend.
2593	38	B	thanks.
2593	12	B	# bye-bye. #
2593	12	A	# okay.
2593	12	A	# bye-bye.
2594	20	A	so, jan, how do they recycle in texas?
2594	5	B	well, i,
2594	4	B	the biggest, uh, way it's going right now, uh,  lot,   most of the grocery stores
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	7	B	have got, uh, things set up s-, where you can bring in your, uh, plastic, and your cans, and newspapers.
2594	4	B	and then they've just got different barrels setting out
2594	4	B	, i shouldn't say barrels, like big john doors or,
2594	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2594	7	B	# whatever # they're,
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	7	B	called. gondolas .
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	4	B	um, they've got them set outside
2594	5	B	and,
2594	13	A	#  is it, #
2594	6	B	# uh, #
2594	7	A	is it  all voluntary?
2594	19	B	yes.
2594	4	B	it's all voluntary.
2594	4	B	now, they do have some places where you can take things and get cash
2594	0	B	but,
2594	6	A	# right. #
2594	7	B	# i # think the lot of people don't really want the cash.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	2	B	you know, they just want to, uh, help recycle. which is,
2594	6	A	# yeah. #
2594	7	B	# what # we do. you know,
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	5	B	we,
2594	4	B	probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in
2594	4	B	and we let the kids get the money for that.
2594	6	A	right.
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	5	B	but, uh,
2594	4	A	# there's, #
2594	5	B	# f-, #
2594	7	A	a lot of projects where the, the boy scouts and things, and that will,
2594	6	B	right.
2594	7	A	collect your cans
2594	0	A	and,
2594	6	B	right.
2594	7	A	it's a good fund raiser for the kids.
2594	3	B	yeah.
2594	3	B	that's true,
2594	4	B	but, but that's really the, the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	5	B	you know but,
2594	5	A	i guess, i,
2594	4	A	you see, i guess it depends on your landfill space.
2594	6	B	uh-huh.
2594	5	A	i know, i,
2594	4	A	we're in maryland,
2594	5	A	but, my,
2594	4	A	i from pennsylvania / *missing copula?
2594	4	A	and my parents how, are forced recycling,
2594	18	B	# oh, #
2594	6	A	# uh, #
2594	7	B	really?
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	4	A	all plastic,  they ha-, all plastic  has to go into a recycling bin, all cans have to be recycled, all newspapers has to be recycled.
2594	9	B	oh, wow.
2594	7	A	because they're, um, they're just running out of space and landfills.
2594	2	A	uh, pennsylvania, ohio, and new york are some of the, uh,
2594	2	A	they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones.
2594	6	B	yeah.
2594	2	A	so, it's really, uh, it's, uh, really hard on them.
2594	4	A	now, up here in maryland, though, we're j-, just in a voluntary recycling stage right now.
2594	4	A	so, uh, so my wife and i, you know, we save our bottles,
2594	4	A	and we save our newspapers,
2594	4	A	and we save all our plastic, and all of our tin cans.
2594	4	A	and just like you say, we go to, uh, a community area where they have it set up
2594	4	A	and we dump them off there.
2594	13	B	so, it's vol-,
2594	19	A	# yeah.
2594	4	A	it's still voluntary, #
2594	4	B	# you say it is # all voluntary.
2594	13	B	do they,
2594	7	A	though i think, i think we're supposed to have something impame-, implemented by nineteen ninety-three, though
2594	13	B	will it be mandatory?
2594	7	A	where some aspects will be mandatory.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	13	B	is it all, um,
2594	13	B	is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff
2594	15	B	or is it all,
2594	4	A	mostly just the cans.
2594	14	B	okay.
2594	5	A	and i,
2594	6	B	# yeah.
2594	5	B	and that's, #
2594	2	A	# and most of # the time, like i said, that's, that's a sort of like fund raiser things that,
2594	6	B	right.
2594	7	A	the schools do, or that the boy scouts do, or whatever.
2594	6	B	right.
2594	6	A	# yeah. #
2594	3	B	# yeah.
2594	3	B	# that's true.
2594	5	B	that's,
2594	2	A	cans are the only thing i think you really get money for.
2594	31	B	well, they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers,
2594	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2594	7	B	# and # stuff like that.
2594	2	B	but, you know, i think a lot of people, like i said, are more concerned,
2594	6	A	right.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	7	B	with, you know, right now, you know, the aspects of saving the earth .
2594	6	A	yeah,
2594	0	B	# um. #
2594	2	A	# i # think that's mostly,
2594	5	A	well, you know, we,
2594	5	A	even before,
2594	4	A	as soon as the community said, you know, we're going to put up bins for recycling, you know, we automatically started,
2594	7	B	uh-huh.
2594	7	A	doing it.
2594	2	A	it was,
2594	6	B	right.
2594	7	A	it's  one of those things,
2594	4	A	you know, and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be,
2594	6	B	uh-huh.
2594	7	A	separated, you know.
2594	5	A	that's,
2594	4	B	well, i tell you, it's kind of funny now at, e-, even at t i, i don't,
2594	13	B	do you work for t i?
2594	26	A	no.
2594	26	A	huh-uh.
2594	14	B	okay.
2594	4	B	um, at t i they're doing recycling.
2594	4	B	i mean, for a long time they didn't do this,
2594	4	B	but now they're, they're recycling cans and paper.
2594	4	B	we have separate bins
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	7	B	uh, separate wastebaskets in our offices
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	7	B	for paper.
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	5	B	you know, and they,
2594	4	B	i mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees
2594	4	B	and, you know
2594	6	A	right.
2594	7	B	it's really,
2594	4	B	i can't believe that
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	7	B	you know. because they've got it all posted all over the place how much,
2594	24	A	# how much, how well they're doing. #
2594	7	B	# they're saving and how w-,
2594	5	B	yeah. #
2594	5	A	we do,
2594	4	A	i, um, i, i work in a, uh, speech interface lab,
2594	6	B	# oh, okay. #
2594	7	A	# at a, # at a, at a college.
2594	4	A	and we do basically the same thing.
2594	4	A	the state of maryland has lost, asked all the colleges and universities, and some of the large organizations, you know, if they would definitely recycle their office paper.
2594	6	B	uh-huh.
2594	0	A	and,
2594	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2594	7	A	# the # same thing, you know, every, almost every college in maryland is recycling office paper.
2594	4	A	but, you know, in the giant bins around,
2594	2	A	and it's surprising how much
2594	6	B	yeah.
2594	7	A	you never realize, because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage,
2594	6	B	# right. #
2594	7	A	# can # every night.
2594	6	B	yep.
2594	0	B	so,
2594	2	A	# you don't notice until, #
2594	7	B	# you don't think about # it.
2594	7	A	you start leaving,
2594	4	A	you know, they don't pick up your recycling until it's full
2594	0	A	and,
2594	6	B	right.
2594	7	A	you just can't believe how much paper that you, uh,
2594	9	B	i know .
2594	2	A	reams of paper come,
2594	6	B	# yep . #
2594	7	A	# out of # an office every day . that ,
2594	7	B	yeah.
2594	2	B	well, you think about,
2594	7	A	took us to recycle.
2594	7	B	the waste, even.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	2	B	i mean, you know, cost wise  and --
2594	6	A	right.
2594	7	B	and,  you know, like you s-, saving trees and stuff like that.
2594	4	B	i mean, it's just amazing, you know,
2594	6	A	# yeah.
2594	2	A	so, i think, #
2594	7	B	# the difference. #
2594	7	A	hopefully, if,
2594	13	A	you know, i guess a lot of the large organizations, probably t i, did they advertise on television how successful they are?
2594	26	B	n-,
2594	16	A	.
2594	4	B	i haven't seen,
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	7	B	anything.
2594	2	B	uh, but that doesn't mean that they don't.
2594	4	B	i don't watch much t v,
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	4	B	but, i haven't really seen anything advertise publicly.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	4	B	and then, like i said, they do a lot of # internal, #
2594	30	A	# internal. #
2594	7	B	advertising on that kind of stuff.
2594	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2594	4	B	# but, # i haven't seen anything.
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	4	B	but see, i don't see a lot of t i advertisements on t v anyway.
2594	2	B	i think they advertise more, um, other places where they're not located.
2594	3	A	right.
2594	3	A	yeah.
2594	3	A	that would probably,
2594	4	B	# you know.  so, #
2594	7	A	# be true. #
2594	7	B	so,  i don't see a lot of advertisements for t i.
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	4	A	because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television,
2594	4	A	you know, they'll jus-, come up and say,
2594	4	A	you know, they'll show you tho-, to encourage , to encourage recycling.
2594	4	A	they'll,
2594	6	B	# right. #
2594	7	A	# say, #
2594	33	A	and here, those of us that dumavra power, which is our power company,
2594	6	B	uh-huh.
2594	7	A	that,
2594	33	A	we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste,
2594	6	B	right .
2594	5	A	and they,
2594	5	A	and that,
2594	33	A	we do this for the community,
2594	2	A	they put those on.
2594	2	A	so i, so i think, you know, we're probably reaching a successful stage and, and just with voluntary,
2594	6	B	right.
2594	7	A	i think.
2594	2	B	well, even, i mean, in the kid's schools,
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	7	B	i mean they do things to try and recycle.
2594	4	B	and, i know my kids, um, like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, oh, look at that. somebody is not saving the earth, you know.
2594	6	A	right.
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	2	B	so, i mean, the kids, i mean, they really try to educate all ages, you know,
2594	2	B	and it's good to start the kids real young on,
2594	3	A	# i think so, too. #
2594	7	B	# stuff like that. #
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	7	B	because, i mean, when i was a kid, they never did stuff like that.
2594	2	B	i mean, it's like nobody was concerned about it.
2594	3	A	right.
2594	3	A	yeah.
2594	2	A	we weren't,
2594	4	B	# you know, and it's like, #
2594	7	A	# concerned.
2594	3	A	yeah.
2594	3	A	that's true. #
2594	4	B	you know, it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things, saying, hey, you know,
2594	6	A	# huh. #
2594	7	B	# we're # ruining the earth,
2594	2	B	you know. and now everybody is doing something about, which is good.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	20	B	but how come we weren't doing this, say, twenty years ago ,
2594	6	A	# yeah. #
2594	7	B	# you # know?
2594	2	A	i, i think really probably what hit peoples, you know, i know that here in the, up in the, uh, uh, the, the new englands area and also in, in pennsylvania, ohio, and new york, the, just run, all of a sudden we're out of landfill.
2594	6	B	uh-huh.
2594	2	A	and, and they're saying, we estimate this landfill be ov-, will be full in two years unless we cut back.
2594	0	A	and,
2594	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2594	7	A	# even # then, you know, we're really running out of space.
2594	2	A	so, i think that, that became,
2594	2	A	that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space,
2594	0	B	well,
2594	7	A	in some of the more crowded states.
2594	7	B	yeah.
2594	5	B	this is,
2594	5	A	so, what,
2594	5	A	you know, and n-, no other state,
2594	4	A	i'm sure texas probably still has some landfill space.
2594	2	A	they're not going to voluntarily say, hey, ship your garbage here.
2594	6	B	right .
2594	0	A	so, you know,
2594	3	B	# yeah.
2594	3	B	that's true. #
2594	7	A	# realistically, you know, # we had, we really had to start, we have to start recycling in some, some, uh, geographic areas.
2594	4	A	it's really,
2594	2	B	i think,
2594	7	A	tough.
2594	7	B	that it, it really surprises me because of the cost savings.
2594	4	B	i mean, this is such a tremendous,
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	7	B	amount of cost savings.
2594	5	B	i mean, why,
2594	8	B	i can't understand why nobody saw that before.
2594	4	B	i mean,  even, even not --
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	7	B	even  the aspects of not saving the earth ,
2594	4	B	e i,
2594	6	A	# right. #
2594	7	B	# mean,  # it's,
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	5	A	but, well,
2594	7	B	so cost, you know,
2594	2	A	well, in some ways, i guess, it, it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it, you know. because,
2594	0	B	# bro-, . #
2594	7	A	# i # know that, like in,
2594	7	B	yeah.
2594	7	A	pennsylvania, they require them to, um, put their newspaper for recycling.
2594	4	A	but, the de-inking process that they have to, they use,
2594	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2594	7	A	# to # take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused
2594	6	B	uh-huh.
2594	7	A	um, is very expensive,
2594	6	B	# oh. #
2594	4	A	# and # also, it w-, it produces  a, a waste,  a, um, a,
2594	6	B	oh.
2594	7	A	liquid waste  that they don't know what to do with yet.
2594	7	B	i see,
2594	0	A	# so, #
2594	6	B	# okay. #
2594	7	A	even some aspects of recycling
2594	24	B	is not
2594	7	A	they still have  cost,
2594	7	B	real cost efficient.
2594	6	B	# oh, okay,
2594	6	B	okay. oh, #
2594	7	A	# yeah, cost  efficient, yet.
2594	5	A	yeah. #
2594	4	B	i,
2594	4	A	so,
2594	7	B	understand that though.
2594	7	A	but  others, you know, like tin cans and plastics,
2594	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2594	7	A	# are, # are really, uh, efficient, you know.
2594	4	A	they,
2594	6	B	right.
2594	7	A	they  melt on quickly and can be, you know, just because of the,
2594	24	B	and glass.
2594	6	B	right.
2594	7	A	heating and things, getting glass.
2594	5	A	yeah.
2594	6	B	uh-huh.
2594	5	A	so, i-,
2594	2	A	it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before.
2594	3	B	yeah.
2594	3	B	that's true.
2594	6	A	# uh-huh.
2594	5	A	yeah. #
2594	5	B	# and even,
2594	4	B	# i, i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	4	B	and, i mean, that kind of surprises me .
2594	4	B	i mean, you know, because once oil gets so, you know, thick and yucky, you'd wonder how they could, you know, clean that up,
2594	6	A	# yeah. #
2594	7	B	# enough # to use it again,
2594	4	B	but they can.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	4	B	um, i don't know how cost efficient that would be, i guess,
2594	6	A	yeah.
2594	28	A	i d-, i don't know either.
2594	5	A	that's,
2594	4	A	i know that though, i, e-, all those petroleum products though are so terrible for your, um, the water table.
2594	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2594	4	A	# you know, # they really pollute quickly
2594	5	A	and, you know, one,
2594	4	A	, i was reading some place the brake fluid,  you put, brake fluid  normally comes in just small little pint containers.
2594	6	B	uh-huh.
2594	7	A	that one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water,
2594	9	B	# wow. #
2594	7	A	# you # know, like hundreds of gallons of water.
2594	2	A	so, it's one of those things that they really,
2594	8	A	um, and you wonder, you know, with all these oil spills.
2594	6	B	yeah
2594	16	B	<breathing>.
2594	7	A	how, how terrible that is .
2594	3	B	yeah.
2594	9	B	i know .
2594	6	A	yeah,
2594	8	A	how terrible that is.
2594	2	A	so, we'll have to, we'll have to keep our eyes on all that, i guess.
2594	6	B	really.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	5	B	i know i really,
2594	28	B	i don't know,
2594	2	B	i, i think that, i mean, i think that they really are doing a good thing now
2594	2	B	and i hope it keeps,
2594	2	B	well, i'm sure we'll keep up.
2594	3	A	yeah.
2594	3	A	i,
2594	13	B	# you know, #
2594	7	A	# agree. #
2594	2	B	i think it's really catching on.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	5	B	you know, i, i think that,
2594	5	B	i'm not sure if it,
2594	28	B	i don't know,
2594	2	B	i think it's a good idea to make it mandatory .
2594	3	A	i do, too.
2594	5	B	um, it,
2594	4	B	because like we were asking some people that live in, um, north dakota, well, are you saving your, you know, are you recycling.
2594	4	B	and they said, well, we're not forced to do it yet,
2594	2	B	so no.
2594	6	A	uh-huh.
2594	28	B	you know, so, i mean i don't know,
2594	2	B	i think that if people are forced, if the people are not forced to do it they may not, d you,
2594	6	A	# yeah.
2594	0	A	it d-, , #
2594	7	B	# know.
2594	28	B	i mean, # i don't know,
2594	2	B	i think a lot of people still will,
2594	0	B	but ,
2594	7	A	well, you know, if they're forced to do it it becomes sort of a habit.
2594	7	B	right.
2594	4	A	you know, i know that it's really funny.
2594	4	A	my parents are forced to do it
2594	5	A	and they,
2598	13	B	do you want to start?
2598	5	B	g-,
2598	3	A	yeah,
2598	21	A	i'm trying to think what i've seen lately.
2598	5	A	i me-, we-,
2598	4	A	well we just finished watching, uh, teenage mutant ninja turtles on tape, you know .
2598	13	B	did you watch dances with wolves,
2598	13	B	did you see the movie?
2598	19	A	yeah,
2598	4	A	we, we've seen that,
2598	19	A	yeah.
2598	13	B	did you like it?
2598	19	A	yeah,
2598	4	A	it was great,
2598	13	A	have you seen it?
2598	2	B	i thought it was very well done.
2598	6	A	yeah,
2598	5	A	i, um,
2598	1	B	how about ghost?
2598	4	A	we, we saw, an, we liked it
2598	2	A	but, you know, i didn't think it was as good as all the, uh, hype was about it.
2598	6	B	right,
2598	4	B	i feel the same way about that too.
2598	2	B	it was okay.
2598	6	A	yeah,
2598	5	A	i don-,
2598	2	A	i, i couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for, uh, best picture.
2598	3	B	no,
2598	3	B	no.
2598	5	B	and, uh, wh-,
2598	21	B	let's see, uh,
2598	4	B	the most recent ones that i've seen are those two, ghost and, uh, dances with wolves,
2598	4	B	but i rent, uh, uh, videos,
2598	13	B	do you?
2598	19	A	yeah,
2598	19	A	yeah,
2598	5	A	and so we just,
2598	13	B	you, you watch many?
2598	27	A	uh, it depends, um, you know, it depends on wh-,
2598	13	B	do you like the classics like, uh, gone with the wind and, uh, you know the older movies.
2598	23	A	i'd like to see those,
2598	4	A	i keep, you know, um, you know, there's like three movies that  i, i keep  telling myself that i should see one of these, you know, some day that i haven't seen, you know, that, that are classics, you know.
2598	4	A	because i've never seen citizen kane,
2598	6	B	# yeah,
2598	2	B	that was good. #
2598	4	A	# and never seen, i've # never seen casablanca and never seen gone with the wind.
2598	4	B	i think i've seen most of humphrey bogart's movies, but, in, in, you know a long time ago,
2598	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2598	4	B	# and, # uh, like the maltese falcon and all those, uh, uh,
2598	5	A	oh, i, i def-,
2598	4	A	we saw part of the african queen on, on t v a couple of years ago,
2598	6	B	# yeah,
2598	2	B	that was good,
2598	6	B	yeah. #
2598	4	A	# and i've, i've alwa-, i've # been wanting to see all of it
2598	4	A	but we just, you know, we walk into the video store
2598	4	A	and we're like well why don't we go see this now ,
2598	5	A	so.
2598	6	B	yeah,
2598	6	B	yeah,
2598	9	B	it's true.
2598	5	A	but, um, i think-,
2598	4	A	one of the movies we saw recently, we saw, uh, misery.
2598	4	B	oh, i didn't see that one.
2598	2	A	that was good, um,
2598	6	B	# really. #
2598	2	A	# oh, # it was great.
2598	16	B	<Laughter>.
2598	5	A	and it,
2598	2	A	you think, you know, for a stephen, you know, it because it was by stephen king it would be really gory
2598	4	A	but there's only one,
2598	4	A	well there's a couple scenes, at, at the end there's, there is, you know some blood and everything
2598	4	A	and there's one really bad scene where it's, i mean, there's not blood but it's pretty graphic .
2598	6	B	yeah.
2598	2	A	but it's, um, it's a really good movie, um.
2598	6	B	really,
2598	13	B	is that the one where, uh, the guy gets captured by that women?
2598	19	A	# yeah,
2598	19	A	yeah, #
2598	14	B	# okay,
2598	6	B	yeah. #
2598	4	A	he's a writer
2598	4	A	and, um, she's his biggest fan
2598	4	A	and she's also ,
2598	6	B	# yeah,
2598	6	B	right. #
2598	7	A	# a little, # a little on the nutso side.
2598	6	B	uh-huh.
2598	13	B	did you see pacific heights?
2598	26	A	no,
2598	4	A	we haven't, um,
2598	4	B	i saw that one,
2598	2	B	that one wasn't that great either.
2598	18	A	oh, it wasn't?
2598	36	B	well i didn't think so,
2598	26	B	no.
2598	5	A	oka-,
2598	5	A	i, i got,
2598	4	A	i heard like mixed reviews, um, of that,
2598	5	A	we s-,
2598	1	B	how about silence of the lambs?
2598	4	A	that's, that's on our list of things to see .
2598	9	B	i know,
2598	4	B	i, i wanted to see,
2598	4	B	i, i was curious if you had seen it
2598	5	B	and that, uh,
2598	5	A	n-,
2598	4	A	our big thing is, um,
2598	4	A	you know, mo-, movie prices up here
2598	4	A	i think it's like six bucks now in the theaters,
2598	6	B	# yeah. #
2598	5	A	# # you know. so it's like,
2598	4	A	you know, a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees
2598	4	A	and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape.
2598	4	B	that's us too,
2598	3	B	yeah,
2598	3	B	yeah
2598	9	B	true.
2598	2	B	i know, it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive.
2598	5	A	ye-,
2598	4	A	well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was, uh, edward scissorhands.
2598	6	B	oh, really.
2598	19	A	yeah,
2598	13	A	have you seen that?
2598	26	B	no.
2598	2	A	oh, it was great .
2598	6	B	really.
2598	19	A	yeah
2598	2	A	it was,
2598	4	B	i thought it was kind of maybe for kids more, than ad-,
2598	31	A	no,
2598	31	A	no,
2598	4	A	it's, um, it's an odd film
2598	4	A	and it's really interesting that,
2598	4	A	i like the director a lot, um, a guy named tim burton.
2598	6	B	uh-huh.
2598	13	A	did you ever see the movie beetlejuice?
2598	23	B	uh, part of it,
2598	4	B	i,
2598	14	A	# oh, ok-, #
2598	7	B	# i  never # really watched the whole thing.
2598	14	A	oh, se-,
2598	6	A	yeah,
2598	2	A	well if you, if you liked beetlejuice you'll probably like edward scissorhands,
2598	2	A	if you didn't like beetlejuice you'll probably won't like edward scissorhands.
2598	6	B	oh, really.
2598	19	A	yeah,
2598	5	A	it's, um,
2598	5	A	burton's kind of, uh, e-,
2598	4	A	he's, a very odd, odd man
2598	5	A	but he's,
2598	4	A	i think he's very interesting
2598	4	A	and, uh, i liked those two movies of his a lot.
2598	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2598	4	A	# he # did batman also, which, you know .
2598	6	B	yeah,
2598	2	B	that was pretty good, though, really.
2598	3	A	it was good,
2598	5	A	but i mean, he was, um,
2598	2	B	when you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies, you know.
2598	3	A	yeah.
2598	4	B	you see it for, uh, you know a couple of hours or an hour
2598	5	B	and it really,
2598	4	B	there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars,
2598	3	A	# oh, yeah, oh. #
2598	7	B	# and all the # different stuff like that, you know.
2598	6	A	yeah.
2598	20	B	whose your favorite actress or actor?
2598	4	A	um, don't really know,
2598	4	A	i like costner a lot
2598	4	A	but, uh,
2598	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2598	7	A	# i'm # a big, i'm a big baseball fan
2598	4	A	so, you know, after bull durham and field of dreams, you know,
2598	6	B	yeah.
2598	5	A	# um, although, you know, #
2598	2	B	# that was good,
2598	4	B	# i saw that movie too.
2598	2	B	that was very good.
2598	20	A	which one?
2598	4	B	field of dreams.
2598	3	A	yeah,
2598	2	A	field of dreams was good,
2598	4	A	um, and, i, i think, i liked the other movies he's done.
2598	4	A	no way out was really good
2598	5	A	and,
2598	3	B	# oh, yeah,
2598	6	B	yeah. #
2598	13	A	# did you ever # see silverado?
2598	30	B	silverado,
2598	20	B	uh, who, who was that with?
2598	21	A	um, let's see.
2598	4	A	danny glover, scott glen, kevin kline, um, brian dennehy , jeff goldblum's in.
2598	4	A	uh, john kreas is in it if you don't blink.
2598	5	B	that,
2598	5	B	the nam-,
2598	4	B	the, the title sounds familiar,
2598	21	B	i'm trying to thi-,
2598	4	A	it was, it was a big western,
2598	4	A	i mean, i think roseanne arquett was in it too, another one that if you blink you'd miss her.
2598	5	A	uh, it was,
2598	4	A	and i think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours,
2598	4	A	and, and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out.
2598	6	B	# oh, really. #
2598	2	A	# um, but # it was, it was really good . um,
2598	4	B	i, i might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although i wo-, i would remember, i think in, with him in it.
2598	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2598	1	B	# how # about revenge,
2598	13	B	did you see that with him?
2598	26	A	no,
2598	4	A	i didn't,
2598	13	A	is that any good?
2598	4	B	with, uh, anthony quinn.
2598	23	B	i thought it was,
2598	4	B	i like everything he's done so far.
2598	14	A	oh, okay.
2598	2	B	you know, it's, uh, one of those movies that it's not a great movie
2598	2	B	but it was okay.
2598	6	A	yeah,
2598	4	A	we were in the video store today
2598	4	A	and somebody was recommending it to somebody.
2598	4	A	you know the, the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else.
2598	6	B	yeah
2598	2	B	it was, it was not a bad movie.
2598	37	A	huh, well, i'll have to catch it one of these days.
2598	5	A	you sa-,
2598	13	A	you, you said you seen no way out?
2598	19	B	yeah,
2598	4	B	that was excellent.
2598	3	A	yeah,
2598	2	A	that was very good.
2598	4	A	um, he was in the untouchables, too.
2598	4	B	now that's another one i wanted to see.
2598	5	B	tha-,
2598	4	B	in fact, that was advertised not too long ago.
2598	6	A	yeah,
2598	5	A	it was on, um,
2598	13	B	# cable? #
2598	26	A	# no,
2598	4	A	# it was on one of the networks, i think last weekend.
2598	14	B	okay,
2598	4	B	i know i saw, # yeah, something about it. #
2598	7	A	# uh, or two weeks # ago.
2598	6	A	yeah,
2598	4	A	i, um, i wish, i, i mean i'd seen it when, when, you know, it was originally in the theaters
2598	4	A	and, um, i saw it, you know, i saw part of it again.
2598	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2598	4	A	# i # mean i like, you know, i like costner,
2598	4	A	i like sean connery,
2598	4	A	and, uh, there's this one, there's this one actor,
2598	4	A	it's really silly that i enjoy him a lot
2598	4	A	but i, i've really enjoyed him in everything i've seen him in, a guy named charles martin smith.
2598	4	B	i don't know him.
2598	4	A	um, you've probably seen him
2598	5	A	and just, an,
2598	4	A	you know, oh, that's who the guy is.
2598	16	B	<Laughter>.
2598	13	A	do you remember,
2598	13	A	did you ever see american graffiti?
2598	26	B	no,
2598	4	B	i, i don't think so.
2598	14	A	oh.
2598	13	A	did you ever see the movie star man.
2598	19	B	yes.
2598	14	A	okay,
2598	4	A	in star man, he was the guy chasing after, um, jeff bridges and karen allen, or nancy allen.
2598	6	B	okay,
2598	6	B	okay.
2598	5	A	you know, w-,
2598	4	A	short nerdy guy with glasses.
2598	6	B	yeah,
2598	6	B	yeah.
2598	5	A	he's, he's just,
2598	4	A	i, i don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in.
2598	4	A	he was in the untouchables.
2598	4	A	he was the accountant .
2598	4	B	oh, oh i know who you mean.
2598	6	A	# yeah. #
2598	13	B	# he # was in, uh, uh, honey don't shrink the kids, wasn't he?
2598	26	A	no,
2598	26	A	no,
2598	2	A	you're thinking of rick moranis.
2598	4	A	he looks like rick moranis
2598	4	A	but he's not .
2598	14	B	oh, okay,
2598	5	B	se-,
2598	6	B	all right,
2598	6	B	yeah,
2598	4	B	that's the one i was thinking of.
2598	4	B	but i have, i've seen quite a few movies,
2598	4	B	i, i enjoy them.
2598	4	B	i think that, uh, it's, it's kind of like, uh, good entertainment.
2598	6	A	yeah.
2598	7	B	an, uh, an escape type of thing.
2598	6	A	yeah.
2598	1	B	how about some of the ads,
2598	13	B	do you go by the ads when you look at them, or the reviews?
2598	13	B	do they influence you a lot.
2598	23	A	uh, a little of,
2598	5	A	e-,
2598	5	A	e-,
2598	4	A	a review usually won't make me go see a movie i hadn't already wanted to see.
2598	6	B	yeah.
2598	13	B	did you see goodfellas?
2598	26	A	no,
2598	5	A	it's o-, uh,
2598	4	A	i want to see it.
2598	2	B	that wa-, that was pretty good.
2598	5	B	um, and,
2598	4	A	um, we want to see godfather part three also
2598	4	A	but my, my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago,
2598	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2598	4	A	# but # i've never seen either of the first, you know, of the, of the godfather movies
2598	4	A	so, we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see godfather part three somewhere.
2598	2	B	i was just going to say, th-, you should see those, fi-, uh, first if you can.
2598	6	A	yeah.
2598	2	B	if y-, if you read the book it's, uh, even better.
2598	2	B	the book was excellent.
2598	6	A	oh, okay,
2598	4	A	i haven't,
2598	6	B	# yeah. #
2598	7	A	# never # read it.
2598	4	B	and, uh, i was a little disappointed in the third on-,
2598	4	B	it's godfather three.
2598	2	B	it was not bad
2598	4	B	but, i expected more, i think.
2598	6	A	uh-huh.
2598	4	A	we just rented, um, a couple weeks ago, a movie called the freshman,
2598	5	A	with, um,
2598	4	A	it's got matthew broderick in it and, um, uh, marlon brando.
2598	4	A	and brando like does a parody of the character he played in the godfather.
2598	6	B	oh, really.
2598	19	A	um, yeah,
2598	4	A	it's, it's one of the reasons why, you know the godfather's been on our minds lately.
2598	4	A	um, but, uh,
2598	16	B	# . #
2598	7	A	# there's # a bunch of scenes from, uh, uh, from the godfather that's used because matthew broderick's going to film school.
2598	4	A	and, uh, in his classes they're using,  there's a bun-, they're running  a bunch of scenes from the godfather
2598	4	A	and then he's running into marlon brando who is playing, you know, this maf-, you know this, uh, organized crime head.
2598	6	B	uh-huh.
2598	2	A	so, it's um, it was, it was a fun movie.
2598	13	B	how about tom cruise, do you like his stuff?
2598	5	A	uh.
2598	7	B	cocktails,
2598	5	B	or, uh,
2598	4	A	i liked rainman,
2598	4	A	i thought, i thought it was interesting that he was doing som-,
2598	3	B	oh, yeah,
2598	2	B	that was good,
2598	4	B	i liked rainman, too.
2598	6	A	yeah,
2598	5	A	well i'm,
2598	4	A	being from baltimore, of course, i'm a big barry levinson fan since, uh, he, he's, you know, he's done a bunch of baltimore movies.
2598	6	B	uh-huh.
2598	5	A	um, n-,
2598	4	A	barry levinson did, um, diner and tinman, and avalon which are all set in baltimore.
2598	6	B	yeah,
2598	4	B	they sound familiar.
2598	4	B	i probably saw parts of those.
2598	4	B	you know, a lot of times i'll wa-, i'll start watching a movie
2598	5	B	and i'm tired
2598	5	B	and it,
2598	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2598	5	B	# next # thing you know, it's, it's
2598	4	B	especially if there's commercial in it .
2598	5	A	# ye-,
2598	5	A	we-, #
2598	4	B	# and then # the titles might sound familiar
2598	4	B	but i really don't know what they're all about.
2598	5	A	ye-,
2598	2	A	of the three of those, diner's probably the best.
2598	2	A	i mean, they're, they're all pretty good,
2598	2	A	but diner is really worth seeing.
2598	13	B	is that the one set in the fifties, or sixties.
2598	23	A	uh, late fifties,
2598	19	A	yeah.
2598	30	B	late fifties,
2598	6	B	yeah,
2598	4	B	i think i saw that one.
2598	6	A	okay
2598	5	A	and, uh,
2598	1	B	how about meryl streep,
2620	0	A	all right,
2620	2	A	i, i think our experience of camping is,
2620	4	A	i, i am the, the passive member,
2620	4	A	i get things ready and then i enjoy.
2620	6	B	uh-huh.
2620	4	A	uh, because, my, my husband is a good camper
2620	5	A	and so they,
2620	4	A	he manages the troops
2620	4	A	and they do the work
2620	4	A	and i have fun .
2620	6	B	uh-huh.
2620	4	B	well, uh, uh, your, you said your family was gro-, uh, all grown up now,
2620	1	B	how about when they were younger,
2620	13	B	did you go cam-, take them camping?
2620	4	A	that's when we camped the most.
2620	6	B	uh-huh.
2620	5	A	when,
2620	2	A	i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because, uh,
2620	16	B	# . #
2620	7	A	# i, # it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just, uh, was really overworked, you know,
2620	4	A	and, and getting out into nature and relaxing,
2620	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2620	7	A	# and # having the family do a good share of the work, you know,
2620	4	A	and the part that i did was more fun than, uh, than labor because they did the, the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize, you know.
2620	6	B	yeah
2620	13	B	bu-, e-, even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun, isn't it.
2620	23	A	it is,
2620	41	A	isn't it.
2620	36	A	it isn't.
2620	20	A	ha-, what kinds of things have you tried?
2620	13	A	have you done, uh, uh, uh, the big pot cooking?
2620	27	B	oh, oh, uh, well, it was really my ex who did the, the, uh, uh, the cooking back when we first started
2620	4	B	and we found that the, you know, what was one, one great handy things was this, uh, uh, uh, hamburger helper.
2620	6	A	oh, yeah.
2620	7	B	because all you needed was a big frying pan,
2620	4	A	# big frying p-, #
2620	4	B	# you dumped everything # in together
2620	4	B	and it was enough for all five of us, six of us.
2620	9	A	oh, that's interesting.
2620	4	A	you know, interesting enough, uh, the food part was kind of, uh, important thing in our camping.
2620	4	A	uh, when my oldest son, uh,
2620	4	A	always at the beginning i did all the shopping and everything.
2620	4	A	but the, the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son mark took his, uh, uh, cooking merit badge in,
2620	4	A	and, and mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff
2620	4	A	and, uh,
2620	6	B	# oh. #
2620	7	A	# i # mean, you know, he did it up really good .
2620	4	A	and so, uh, after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and preparing, getting ready for it.
2620	9	B	well that's great.
2620	4	A	it was, it was a marvelous experience because after that, then all i had to do was, uh, follow the instructions, you know and do.
2620	4	A	and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things
2620	4	A	like i would take corn bread and, uh, cook a pan inside of a pan over a, over a camp, uh, stove.
2620	6	B	uh-huh.
2620	4	A	and it works real good.
2620	4	A	it's like an oven.
2620	4	B	# well, #
2620	11	A	# just # put, uh, put a thing on it.
2620	7	B	cooking was our secondary interest,
2620	28	B	i mean.
2620	20	A	what did you like to do most?
2620	4	B	well really just commune with nature.
2620	13	A	that's neat isn't it?
2620	4	B	we started out, uh,
2620	4	B	well we were living in florida at the time
2620	4	B	and we, early in life, we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very, very expensive.
2620	3	A	right.
2620	4	A	i agree.
2620	4	B	so my ex decided, we're going to try camping
2620	4	B	and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent.
2620	16	A	<Laughter>.
2620	4	B	and that's how we got started.
2620	6	A	# huh. #
2620	4	B	# we # did it for years and years, uh.
2620	13	A	well now in florida, is ther-, is there ti-, are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot.
2620	39	B	well, ye-, uh,
2620	27	B	yes and no.
2620	4	B	i mean, um, ye-, in the winter time yes,
2620	4	B	it's, it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly.
2620	6	A	uh-huh.
2620	4	B	but, uh, there's really no time of the year that you can't go.
2620	13	A	# oh, is that true? #
2620	5	B	# uh, becau-, #
2620	4	A	now, now we're, we're in texas now
2620	13	A	and you're in texas,
2620	41	A	right.
2620	19	B	yes,
2620	4	B	i'm in dallas.
2620	14	A	okay, uh,
2620	4	A	we have not camped a great deal here because, uh, a good share of the time in the summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping.
2620	4	B	well, it just depends on where you go,
2620	2	B	for instance,
2620	5	A	# i gue-, #
2620	7	B	# if you # went down to the sea shore, it would be wonderful, a nice breeze blowing in from the water.
2620	6	A	yeah,
2620	6	A	yeah,
2620	4	A	we have done that .
2620	4	A	but, but we camped mostly,
2620	4	A	when the kids were little we were in, we were in new jersey, and w-,
2620	0	B	oh, where abouts?
2620	7	A	uh, in, uh, allendale and, uh, and, uh, waldwick,
2620	4	A	it's just about twelve miles south of, the new york border.
2620	7	B	uh-huh.
2620	4	A	and we'd go up to the adirondacks and camp
2620	4	A	and it was so, you know, pick your own, uh, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast .
2620	3	B	oh yes,
2620	3	B	yes,
2620	5	B	ye-,
2620	5	A	uh, also,
2620	4	B	# i co-, #
2620	11	A	# go ahead. #
2620	7	B	i come  from up in that area,
2620	4	B	i'm a new yorker myself.
2620	18	A	oh, are you?
2620	20	A	where did you live?
2620	4	B	a little town called tuckaho, over by white plains.
2620	6	A	oh, oh yeah,
2620	4	A	i know that.
2620	4	A	i had a cousin who lived in white plains,
2620	2	A	that's a, that's a neat area.
2620	2	A	but it's a, that is a particularly neat area for camping because,
2620	4	B	well that i wouldn't know
2620	4	B	i left there when i was quite young.
2620	6	A	yeah,
2620	2	A	it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by,
2620	4	A	you don't have to go very far.
2620	6	B	uh-huh.
2620	4	A	and, uh, and there's, uh, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, uh, hiking sort of things
2620	4	A	and, and we had, uh, collapsible boat which we, clipper, little clipper sail boat.
2620	6	B	uh-huh.
2620	4	A	and so we would sail and, and, uh, did a lot of camping that way.
2620	4	B	well, uh, me, i outgrew, uh, sleeping bags and, uh, tents,
2620	16	A	# . #
2620	4	B	# and # i now have a motor home.
2620	18	A	oh, do you.
2620	4	A	we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis
2620	2	A	and it's fun, too, i think.
2620	4	B	well i live in mine.
2620	18	A	do you?
2620	19	B	yes.
2620	2	A	that's neat,
2620	13	A	so you kind of, uh, uh, an everyday camper .
2620	19	B	uh, well, yes
2620	4	B	i consider myself what they call a full-timer.
2620	29	A	a full time camper.
2620	3	B	yeah
2620	5	B	th-,
2620	13	A	well now, are you living alone now,
2620	5	A	or,
2620	19	B	ye-,
2620	28	B	well just me and my dog.
2620	29	A	you and your dog, huh, .
2620	3	B	yeah.
2620	9	A	hey,
2620	9	A	that sounds great.
2620	4	A	well, we don't, we don't camp quite as much as we used to,
2620	2	A	but, uh, i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family,
2620	3	B	# oh yes,
2620	3	B	definitely. #
2620	7	A	# and enjoy nature # and, uh, kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life.
2620	5	A	i'd always,
2620	29	B	# nothing like the fresh outdoors. #
2620	3	A	# right,
2620	4	A	i'd always come home # just relaxed and, uh, comfortable and ready to go at it again,
2620	2	A	so it was a neat activity.
2620	12	A	good to talk to you.
2620	11	A	tell me your name again.
2620	4	B	jack.
2620	30	A	jack,
2620	6	B	# uh-huh. #

2620	9	A	how about that.
2620	4	A	well we're all, lots of people from t i up this way.
2620	6	B	uh-huh.
2620	12	A	all right,
2620	12	A	good to talk to you.
2620	12	B	nice talking to you too, beth.
2620	12	A	all right,
2620	12	A	all right,
2620	12	A	bye-bye.
2620	12	B	bye.
2621	2	A	well a lot of women are knowl-, as knowledge about football as i am.
2621	16	B	<Laughter>.
2621	13	A	can i guess your favorite team, if you had one, might be the steelers.
2621	19	B	yes,
2621	19	B	uh-huh.
2621	4	A	well, i can understand that.
2621	4	A	i, you know, i kind of like the cowboys, too.
2621	13	B	# do you? #
2621	23	A	# they've had # some great games in the past.
2621	6	B	uh-huh,
2621	4	B	i, i always enjoy watching the stal-, the, dallas and pittsburgh together.
2621	6	A	uh-huh,
2621	3	A	me too.
2621	7	B	you know.
2621	2	A	it wasn't nearly as much fun when bradshaw was playing for you guys, i'll tell you.
2621	16	B	<Laughter>.
2621	4	A	he lives in the dallas area now, as a matter of fact.
2621	13	B	does he really?
2621	4	A	well, actually, it's probably closer to fort worth,
2621	4	A	but it's, it's in the same area.
2621	4	A	he bought, uh, bought a big horse farm out in a little town called roanoke, texas.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	4	A	but he pops up on the dallas scene quite often.
2621	16	B	<Laughter>.
2621	4	A	as a matter of fact, there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job.
2621	9	B	oh, wo-,
2621	13	B	i wonder if he'd ever do that.
2621	27	A	i don't know,
2621	2	A	he'd be good at it.
2621	2	A	he's such a motivator, he,
2621	3	B	# yes. #
2621	7	A	# primarily, # you know, with the quarterbacks.
2621	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2621	2	A	# that # would be his specialty.
2621	2	A	i wished, i wished they could work something,
2621	4	A	i really like him.
2621	4	A	i really do.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	1	B	well what about the houston oilers.
2621	13	B	do you like them?
2621	19	A	yeah,
2621	0	A	okay,
2621	4	A	i'd love to see dallas and houston play in a super bowl.
2621	2	A	that would be really great.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	that may not ever happen,
2621	28	A	i don't know.
2621	16	B	# . #
2621	2	A	# uh, houston # has had some wonderful talent, you know, down through the years
2621	2	A	and in the earlier years they really had some super teams.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	B	and warren moon,
2621	9	A	# that's right. #
2621	7	B	# is, is # proving himself quite well right now.
2621	3	A	he certainly is,
2621	2	A	he's very good.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	he's very good.
2621	2	B	he's one of the few, uh, black quarterbacks that there are.
2621	3	A	that's right.
2621	2	A	randall cunningham was with philadelphia, i guess last year,
2621	4	A	but he's no longer with the team.
2621	2	A	so, you're right,
2621	2	A	there are very few black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	1	A	how do you think the steelers are going to do this year.
2621	13	A	you have any idea.
2621	27	B	i don't know,
2621	2	B	i hope they, they do better.
2621	5	B	they, they
2621	2	B	during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better.
2621	6	A	uh-huh.
2621	2	B	but, uh, i think they still have a little, i think they're still such a, a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential,
2621	6	A	# yeah. #
2621	7	B	# # that it did when ever bradshaw was playing.
2621	6	A	oh, yeah,
2621	2	A	that was just such super team.
2621	2	B	or, if they even reach that potential again, you know, they may never reach that again.
2621	6	A	yeah.
2621	9	A	well that's a tough,
2621	2	A	it would be tough to do,
2621	2	A	it really would.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	13	A	they have such a super team for years, that won what, four super bowls?
2621	19	B	yeah,
2621	4	B	four in a row.
2621	4	A	four in a row.
2621	4	A	i don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not.
2621	4	B	oh, i don't know.
2621	6	A	# yeah. #
2621	4	B	# shooting # for one for the thumb now is what they were saying.
2621	9	A	that's right .
2621	5	A	and,
2621	4	B	but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now,
2621	5	B	so.
2621	9	A	that's right.
2621	2	B	i think mike webster was left
2621	4	B	but then he, he just left.
2621	6	A	uh-huh,
2621	6	A	yeah.
2621	5	B	uh.
2621	2	A	he may have been the last of the old guard,
2621	28	A	i don't know.
2621	3	B	yeah,
2621	2	B	i think he is,
2621	2	B	i think he was.
2621	6	A	uh-huh,
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	2	A	they had such a super team.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	13	A	have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday?
2621	26	B	no,
2621	4	B	i didn't.
2621	14	A	i see.
2621	6	B	huh-uh.
2621	2	A	there's quite a bit of activity now,
2621	2	A	of course they had so many, you know, nice, uh, choices because their record was so lousy the last few years.
2621	4	A	they picked up,
2621	5	B	# uh. #
2621	7	A	# you # know, quite a few of the,
2621	2	A	of course you never know.
2621	2	A	the guys they pick, you know, m-, may never play a game.
2621	2	A	you jus-, never know,
2621	2	A	it's, it's a gamble,
2621	2	A	it really is.
2621	6	B	yeah,
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	4	A	they may get hurt, or, not be able to participate at that level, if you know,
2621	20	B	well who would you say is your favorite player, or has ever been your favorite player?
2621	13	A	ever been?
2621	19	B	uh-huh.
2621	4	A	probably an old guy that played, probably before you were born ,
2621	16	B	<Laughter>.
2621	4	A	his name was sam huff.
2621	4	A	he used to play for the new york giants.
2621	6	B	oh.
2621	4	A	that was one of the toughest guys that i've ever seen in my life,
2621	6	B	# really. #
2621	7	A	# as # far as, you know, dedication.
2621	2	A	he just went all out every single play.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	of course, there have been some other great ones too, dick butkis, and bradshaw, you know,
2621	2	A	there's been so many.
2621	6	B	yeah,
2621	5	B	ye-,
2621	4	A	but if i had to pick one, i would probably pick sam huff, as a matter of fact.
2621	2	B	oh, you know, that's really funny, um,
2621	4	B	well, i, i come from a large family
2621	4	B	and, the-, there's quite a few boys
2621	4	B	so that's kind of how i got in with the football.
2621	4	B	either watch that or watch nothing.
2621	6	A	that's right.
2621	4	B	and, um, at one time i could name all the players on the steelers, you know.
2621	6	A	uh-huh.
2621	4	B	and, but, even when bradshaw was playing, i, i don't know, i, i didn't particularly care for him,
2621	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2621	4	B	# i # thought he was kind of cocky or something.
2621	2	A	# he is,
2621	2	A	he is, #
2621	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2621	2	A	of course the-, a quarterback has a big ego.
2621	6	B	yeah,
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	they really d-, they have to have,
2621	2	A	they can't survive.
2621	6	B	uh-huh,
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	they always think they can win, you know, which is the way it should be.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	4	A	boy, he never gave up, i'll tell you.
2621	6	B	yeah
2621	4	B	him and franco harris,
2621	4	B	i really didn't care for the either two of them.
2621	6	A	# uh-huh,
2621	6	A	uh-huh, #
2621	2	B	# i mean # they were good,
2621	2	B	but, i, you know, you couldn't deny that.
2621	6	A	# oh yeah. #
2621	4	B	# but i # didn't,  i thought, you know, well i just didn't  really care for either one of them.
2621	6	A	uh-huh.
2621	4	B	uh, today, my favorites out of those guys were probably, um, lambert,
2621	6	A	uh-huh.
2621	7	B	ham,
2621	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2621	7	B	# and, # uh, stallworth and swan.
2621	6	A	uh-huh,
2621	3	A	absolutely,
2621	3	A	i can't disagree with that.
2621	2	A	they were super players,
2621	2	A	they really were.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	5	A	they really,
2621	4	B	i, i, i like, not just with the pittsburgh, i like watching on saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or  the, the best plays   from,
2621	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2621	7	B	# you # know, from  the week or something.
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	4	A	highlights, yeah.
2621	6	B	yeah,
2621	4	B	i love watching that.
2621	4	B	then i like watching their bloopers too, you know .
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	2	A	that's kind of funny too, as a matter of fact .
2621	2	A	some of them a, a bit embarrassing.
2621	5	A	yeah,
2621	2	A	well they make mistakes too, i guess.
2621	6	B	yeah,
2621	6	B	uh-huh,
2621	5	A	# absol-, #
2621	2	B	# it's # funny that more people don't get hurt.
2621	3	A	absolutely.
2621	7	B	you know, especially, i would say the receivers,
2621	6	A	# uh-huh,
2621	5	A	oh they, #
2621	7	B	# when they're in # the air and they get tackled.
2621	7	A	they take such a beating.
2621	3	B	oh, yeah,
2621	2	B	it's funny some of their necks don't get broken.
2621	3	A	absolutely,
2621	4	A	i don't know how they do it.
2621	2	A	it's, it must just take a hundred percent concentration, i guess, because they know they're going to get hit,
2621	2	A	it's just a matter of how hard, you know, or where.
2621	6	B	yeah.
2621	2	B	an they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically.
2621	3	A	oh, absolutely.
2621	2	A	they look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem.
2621	16	B	<Throat_clearing>  <laughter>.
2621	2	A	gosh, what a beating,
2621	2	A	they really do take a beating,
2621	2	A	they really do.
2621	6	B	yeah.
2621	1	B	well what did you think of, um. a couple years ago for the bears, the refrigerator.
2621	2	A	i think he was just probably a passing phenomena, i think .
2621	16	B	<Laughter>.
2621	28	A	i don't know,
2621	5	A	i, i'm knowing what, you know,
2621	2	A	of course, mike ditka was in dallas for years and years as coach, is knowing his, or, you know, knowing of his temperament, i'm just surprised he ever, you know, kept the guy around,
2621	2	A	i really am.
2621	2	A	he's such a, he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper.
2621	2	B	oh, you know, and to me he does, um, oh, he's just so big and fat,
2621	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2621	2	B	# he # doesn't even look like he's in shape.
2621	2	B	he's just so big, no one can move him.
2621	9	A	that's right, yeah,
2621	3	A	absolutely.
2621	2	A	there's just so much mass there, i guess they just can't,
2621	28	A	i don't know, you know,
2621	5	A	i,
2621	2	A	probably the guy is, you know, probably physically strong.
2621	5	A	i, you know,
2621	2	A	obviously not very fast.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	but i guess it's just, like you say, a mass that nobody can seem t-, to get out of the way.
2621	2	A	as far as him scoring touch downs, you know, i think that was kind of weird.
2621	16	B	<Laughter>.
2621	28	A	i don't know,
2621	4	A	dallas has a guy, uh, his name is nate newton,
2621	2	A	now he has a real weight problem too.
2621	2	A	he fights it every single year,
2621	4	A	but, he manages to still keep playing,
2621	2	A	but,
2621	6	B	# yeah. #
2621	7	A	# he # has a terrible weight problem.
2621	9	B	wow.
2621	5	A	they wa-,
2621	4	A	the coaches watch him all year long.
2621	4	A	they, they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not, you know, completely out of control.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	but i guess most every team has so-, has someone like that,
2621	5	A	i don't,
2621	6	B	oh, yeah,
2621	2	B	there's, there are some really big guys playing in football.
2621	2	A	absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	i guess you have to to, you know, to stay in the game i guess.
2621	6	B	yeah,
2621	3	B	you would, uh-huh.
2621	6	A	yeah.
2621	5	B	um, now who,
2621	13	B	would you say that you have a fav-,
2621	13	B	i mean other than dallas, would you say that you have, uh, a favorite quarterback.
2621	4	B	i mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the, the attention, you know.
2621	19	A	oh, yeah,
2621	4	A	sure,
2621	2	A	well, you'd have to, uh, or i would have to say, you know, someone like montana, i guess, who's done so well for so many years.
2621	6	B	yeah,
2621	4	B	i re-, i, i enjoy watching him play.
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	2	A	his age is about to catch up with him though.
2621	16	B	<Laughter>.
2621	2	A	he's no spring chicken anymore.
2621	6	B	# no,
2621	2	B	but he's still performing. #
2621	2	A	# and like you say warren moon's an excellent,
2621	2	A	warren moon's an # excellent.
2621	2	A	but he's very exciting to watch.
2621	3	B	yes he is,
2621	6	A	# uh-huh,
2621	6	A	sure. #
2621	2	B	# i, i, # i enjoy watching him also.
2621	6	A	uh-huh,
2621	3	A	absolutely.
2621	1	B	what about, uh, marino?
2621	5	A	uh, i'm,
2621	28	A	obviously he's a very good quarterback,
2621	4	A	i'd, i never was, you know, too, a whole lot of, a big fan, you know.
2621	2	B	i think he'll get better as he gets older.
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	2	A	he may, uh-huh.
2621	7	B	because he, he well wa-, he was the youngest quarterback there was, wasn't he?
2621	19	A	yes
2621	4	A	he was,
2621	2	A	i believe that's right at one point in time.
2621	5	A	ye-,
2621	2	A	but he's a very young fellow.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	2	A	of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot, if he's got a good supporting cast, you know.
2621	9	B	# that's true,
2621	9	B	that's true. #
2621	2	A	# if not, he gets # beat to death like poor old troy aikman has the last couple of years anyway,
2621	5	A	you kno-,
2621	5	A	we-,
2621	2	A	dallas did better last year,
2621	2	A	hopefully they'll do better this year.
2621	35	B	uh, probably around twelve, uh-huh.
2621	6	B	yeah,
2621	28	B	uh, i didn't, i don't know,
2621	2	B	i, i just think, you know marino will get better
2621	2	B	and, uh, his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the super bowl,
2621	9	A	# that's right. #
2621	7	B	# you know,
2621	5	B	# so.
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	2	A	miami's had some down years, too.
2621	6	B	yeah.
2621	2	A	but they all do, i guess,
2621	2	A	it's, it's cyclical, i guess.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	7	A	as the players get older, get slower.
2621	6	B	yeah
2621	9	B	. that's true,
2621	5	B	ye-,
2621	2	B	and with age comes,
2621	6	A	# yeah,
2621	5	A	with
2621	5	A	yeah, #
2621	7	B	# you know,
2621	5	B	the, # the
2621	2	B	i'm sure arthritis sets in with them,
2621	3	A	oh yes, # very much so. #
2621	7	B	# you know. #
2621	24	A	hip injuries and things like that, yeah.
2621	6	B	right,
2621	6	B	yeah.
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	2	A	that, that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game.
2621	6	B	uh-huh,
2621	2	B	and they're so young,
2621	9	A	# that's right. #
2621	2	B	# but, they're # retired, you know,
2621	2	B	and their so young still.
2621	6	A	uh-huh,
2621	6	A	yeah,
2621	4	A	i read some time, well not too long ago that the average, uh, professional career only lasts seven years.
2621	7	B	oh.
2621	2	A	so that's when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course.
2621	6	B	oh yeah,
2621	2	B	but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that.
2621	4	A	but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years, you know.
2621	6	B	yeah,
2621	4	B	a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple.
2621	9	A	that's right, yeah, *should this be two slash units?
2621	5	A	that's ri-,
2621	2	B	holy smokes, i didn't that doesn't seem like very long.
2621	2	A	that's, that's a pretty short career on average.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	of course they play their, you know, cards right and do some good investments, they'll, you know, they'll do all right.
2621	6	B	uh-huh.
2621	2	A	but a lot of them don't, unfortunately.
2621	6	B	yeah.
2621	1	B	um, what do you think of the, uh, l a raiders,
2621	13	B	used to the, the oakland?
2621	19	A	yeah,
2621	2	A	they, they're always branded, you know, as a bunch of outlaws
2621	2	A	and,
2621	16	B	# . #
2621	7	A	# if # their, if their, you know, arrest record won't let abl-, won't let them play anywhere else, they seem to go to, they seem to go to the raiders.
2621	16	B	# . #
2621	2	A	# but # that just may be, you know, perceived,
2621	2	A	you know perception,
2621	28	A	i don't know.
2621	6	B	# yeah. #
2621	2	A	# al # davis is, he's a kind of strange character, strange, strange looking guy.
2621	2	A	apparently he's kind of a wild guy,
2621	28	A	i don't really know for sure.
2621	2	A	they've had some excellent teams, though, obviously.
2621	3	B	yes,
2621	2	B	they have.
2621	2	A	i'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play,
2621	2	A	they keeping talk about, you know, going,
2623	0	A	okay .
2623	11	A	i'll let you go ahead .
2623	3	B	okay.
2623	4	B	i, uh, i have five children all together.
2623	6	A	oh, uh-huh.
2623	4	B	uh, my oldest two are already out and about in the world
2623	4	B	and i, uh, have a set of twins that are fourteen
2623	6	A	oh.
2623	4	B	and, uh, my youngest is twelve.
2623	9	A	that's great.
2623	4	A	i always thought it'd be great to have twins.
2623	6	B	uh, yeah.
2623	2	B	if you like doing everything twice .
2623	6	A	well, yeah
2623	16	A	<laughter>.
2623	4	B	uh, at any rate, um, my first two children, uh, i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	um, and, you know, was a, a problem with having five children needing to work a, uh, a full-time job that,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	was more than a full-time job.
2623	4	B	i,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	worked about fifty-one hours a week, because i worked every, worked eleven hours every sunday.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	and, uh, so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i, as i should have, as i really wanted to.
2623	13	A	your first ones you mean, it,
2623	19	B	yeah.
2623	5	B	the,
2623	7	A	was this way?
2623	19	B	yeah,
2623	5	B	the f-,
2623	4	B	well, it was with all of them,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	but it was, uh, more an impact, i think, on the oldest two.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	because, um, oh, about the time i got out of working that long hours was when the, uh, when the twins were about three years old.
2623	4	B	and, uh, they never, you know, i don't think they noticed i wasn't around that much.
2623	6	A	oh.
2623	4	B	you know, with all the children around the house, it's,
2623	6	A	right.
2623	7	B	kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around,
2623	16	A	<Laughter>.
2623	7	B	very much.
2623	4	B	um, so, what i've tried to do, uh, now that i've, uh, fi-,
2623	4	B	went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	and, uh, so, then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty-one hours,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	a week.
2623	4	B	so, i've tried to spend more time with, uh, the children since then.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	um, what i'm currently doing is, uh, taking a lot of time.
2623	4	B	i'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings.
2623	4	B	um, we just started a thing where every other week we go to, uh, movies.
2623	4	B	there's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on wednesday nights.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	and so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	movies.
2623	4	B	and, it's working out pretty well.
2623	4	B	um, we're spending more time together.
2623	4	B	i feel like i'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	um, in fact, i found that i'm a lot closer with, uh,
2623	4	B	i have one son who's gone
2623	4	B	and i don't even know where he's at.
2623	6	A	huh.
2623	4	B	um, he's taken off for parts unknown,
2623	9	A	that's difficult.
2623	3	B	but, uh, yeah.
2623	6	A	yeah.
2623	5	B	a-,
2623	4	B	and, uh, my daughter is, um, has moved out of the house.
2623	4	B	her and i get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house .
2623	6	A	uh-huh
2623	4	A	. it happens that way .
2623	4	B	and uh, so it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,
2623	4	B	and i think it's important that we do, because, uh, i notice that, uh, when i had spent two years down in dallas, down there they all have a, uh, a me kind of attitude.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	and i noticed parents not spending time with their,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	children and, and going out and doing things.
2623	4	B	and, you know, i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine
2623	5	B	and,
2623	6	A	um, uh-huh.
2623	7	B	you know, it just, you know,
2623	4	B	i saw the family falling apart down,
2623	2	A	texas is,
2623	7	B	there.
2623	7	A	much worst for the drugs.
2623	2	A	i mean, it was bad enough every place else,
2623	4	A	but drugs is, in texas, are extremely bad.
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	4	B	and so, i think it's kind of important that i, that i, you know, nurture the relationship i have with my children now.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	and i'm doing my best
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	to keep that up.
2623	4	A	well, that's all you can do.
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	20	B	what's your, been your experience?
2623	13	A	well, i, i was going to ask, too, does your wife work?
2623	23	B	um, she didn't up until the last, oh, six months.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	5	B	um.
2623	13	A	she just recently started working then.
2623	23	B	she just recently,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	started working.
2623	4	B	uh, she worked a job until we moved to our new house
2623	4	B	and, uh, she quit that job because it was too inconvenient.
2623	4	B	and,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	uh, she starts a new job tomorrow, which should take her out of the house about four days a week.
2623	6	A	oh, uh-huh.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	9	A	so, that sounds great.
2623	4	A	well, uh, we also have five children.
2623	6	B	huh.
2623	4	A	and, but ours are all out of the nest .
2623	16	B	<Laughter>.
2623	4	A	so, uh, as, when they were growing up, i, probably we had a lot of similar things l-, like you had, you know, having the time.
2623	2	A	when you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones.
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	4	A	but, uh, we were, we're very active, of course, at church, and, uh, boy scouting, and girl scouts, four h, uh,
2623	4	A	and those activities helped a lot in,
2623	6	B	uh-huh.
2623	7	A	giving us things to do with the children.
2623	4	A	and uh, we try to take a vacation with them every year, camping of some sort, something that wasn't expensive.
2623	4	A	and, uh, our youngest is, uh, expecting her first baby.
2623	4	A	so, they're, they're all out and on their own.
2623	5	A	they're,
2623	4	A	and we have one to get married yet .
2623	4	A	and they'll all be married.
2623	4	A	uh, and they're, they're all doing pretty good.
2623	5	A	they, uh,
2623	13	A	t lives in pittsburgh, you probably don't know where that is.
2623	23	B	certainly do.
2623	14	A	okay.
2623	4	A	two of our children live there.
2623	4	A	uh, one, i, like i said, lives near maryl-,  in, in around maryland,  d c.
2623	4	A	he works right on the border of d c.
2623	6	B	uh-huh.
2623	4	A	and one lives in connecticut
2623	4	A	and our baby lives just a mile over the hill ,
2623	16	B	<Laughter>.
2623	7	A	so, we'll get to see her a little more than, uh, what we do the other ones.
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	9	B	that sounds great.
2623	4	B	i've, i've noticed, uh, another thing, um, when i was younger my father was always working.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	A	well,
2623	5	B	and,
2623	7	A	they have to.
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	6	A	yeah.
2623	4	B	and, uh, you know, he, uh, he worked a full-time job and a part-time job,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	and i never saw him.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	so, i didn't have much of a role model to go by.
2623	24	A	to go, to follow.
2623	7	B	d you,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	know,  to learn how to be a, a father and,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	a parent, and that kind of thing, because,
2623	6	A	yeah.
2623	7	B	i, i can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	catch with my dad, or doing anything with my dad.
2623	2	A	and that does make a big difference.
2623	3	B	yeah.
2623	5	B	and it,
2623	5	B	if you don't have,
2623	5	B	i don't,
2623	5	B	i,
2623	2	B	it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	then it's kind of tough.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	2	B	you know, everybody's not father knows best.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	6	B	yeah,
2623	5	A	that's,
2623	5	B	but,
2623	7	A	that's,
2623	2	A	well none of us are.
2623	2	A	let's face it,
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	7	A	you know, we're not none of us like they pro-, portray it on those shows.
2623	2	A	i mean,
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	7	A	life's much more difficult than that.
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	2	B	e i,
2623	5	A	and, uh,
2623	7	B	mean,  the, the, the capability to, uh, create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the, uh, the mental capacity to raise them .
2623	6	A	right.
2623	6	A	right.
2623	5	B	and,
2623	4	A	now, our daughter, our, well, she's our second oldest, she has, she's the only that, other one that has children.
2623	4	A	she has two boys.
2623	4	A	and, she works full time
2623	4	A	and i have mixed feelings about that.
2623	4	A	she's able to do that
2623	4	A	and i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home.
2623	4	A	but, yet, on the other hand, i, i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children.
2623	4	A	i'm kind of old fashioned, i guess, that way.
2623	6	B	yes.
2623	4	A	but they seem to, they seem to give, uh, quality time to those children when they are together.
2623	4	A	and, and so, it seems, it seems for them that it works out all right.
2623	28	A	so, i don't know.
2623	4	A	i, i don't think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family.
2623	5	A	so ,
2623	6	B	yes.
2623	7	A	i ,
2623	2	B	it's, it's not easy.
2623	6	A	yeah.
2623	4	B	i've, uh, you know, i've helped out extremely, uh,
2623	4	B	well, i can't say that,
2623	4	B	but i've helped out ,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	as best i could at home.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	2	B	and, uh, y-, as you know, with five children it takes a lot of work.
2623	3	A	yes.
2623	4	A	it does,
2623	2	B	even,
2623	7	A	it, it,
2623	5	A	yeah.
2623	7	B	if,  even if  someone's home all the time, there's still a lot of things that have to be done.
2623	6	A	yeah.
2623	20	A	what line of work are you in now since you went to school
2623	0	A	and, *slash error
2623	4	B	uh, well, now i work for texas instruments.
2623	7	A	oh,
2623	4	B	so,
2623	7	A	okay.
2623	7	B	so,  i'm in computers.
2623	14	A	okay.
2623	4	A	a lot of the people i've, that's call-, i've talked to work for, uh, for the same.
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	5	A	uh.
2623	5	B	and so, i've, uh,
2623	4	B	prior to that i, uh, i worked in a food store.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	5	B	and, uh, you know, wor-,
2623	13	A	which your income would be a lot better,
2623	0	B	uh, *slash error
2623	7	A	now.
2623	7	B	right. / *slash error
2623	6	A	yeah.
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	4	B	it, uh, it was, uh, it was a, a smart move to make.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	um,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	i was more intelligent than the position i was holding.
2623	6	A	right.
2623	5	B	and, uh,
2623	2	A	and it's,
2623	7	B	it was,
2623	7	A	kind of a waste of a person.
2623	3	B	yes.
2623	4	B	i, i,
2623	0	A	you know.
2623	7	B	felt that it certainly was,
2623	4	B	i mean,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	B	and, uh, you know, every time something new came up, i was explaining it to them.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	5	B	and,
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	uh, i,
2623	13	A	and  you,
2623	7	B	had,
2623	7	A	you  recognized this and,
2623	0	B	no .
2623	7	A	was able to, you know,
2623	19	B	yeah.
2623	5	B	i, uh,
2623	7	A	do something about it.
2623	19	B	yeah.
2623	4	B	i, uh, started back to school.
2623	4	B	in fact, i was going to school while i was working fifty-one hours a week
2623	5	B	and that's why i,
2623	2	B	you know
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	7	B	if you're working, if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty-one hours a week, there's not much time left to spend with,
2623	2	A	well, it puts a strain on everybody, your wife and your family.
2623	6	B	yeah
2623	16	B	<breathing>.
2623	2	A	and, the only thing you can remember is to  try and stay together as much as you can,
2623	16	B	<Laughter>.
2623	7	A	because it's very easy to, uh, become, go your own direction
2623	6	B	yeah
2623	16	B	<breathing>.
2623	7	A	when you're s-, when you're working so hard and going to school, too.
2623	6	B	yeah.
2623	4	B	well, it, it all paid off.
2623	9	A	well, that's wonderful.
2623	4	B	so, uh, you know, i got my degree and got the better paying job,
2623	4	B	and
2623	6	A	uh-huh .
2623	7	B	and,  uh, you know, we, i think as a family we're a lot better off.
2623	6	A	uh-huh.
2623	4	A	it sounds to me like, uh, you're doing well.
2623	4	A	my husband's retired,
2623	4	A	so, uh, he's been retired for three years now.
2623	6	B	uh-huh.
2623	6	A	yeah.
2623	2	A	that's quite a change.
2623	6	B	yeah,
2623	4	B	well, my goal is to try to retire by the time i'm fifty-five.
2623	4	A	oh, well, he made it at fifty .
2623	9	B	great.
2623	4	A	it was a magic number for him
2623	4	A	and, and, uh, he went at fifty,
2623	4	A	and he still works part time at other thing, you know, same job as he was doing, only he's retired and doing it independently.
2623	6	B	uh-huh.
2623	4	A	but, uh, nevertheless retired.
2623	5	B	well, i'm .
2630	0	A	okay
2630	13	A	he did really decide to go?
2630	13	B	um, to williams college in massachusetts?
2630	3	A	uh-huh,
2630	3	A	sure
2630	4	A	i'm familiar with it,
2630	7	B	and that he was trying to decide between university of pennsylvania and williams,
2630	4	B	and it was a very difficult choice
2630	0	B	and, uh, *slash unit?
2630	13	A	and he, well, he must know, is he interested in law or medicine,

2630	0	B	but that's one of the reasons why he chose williams

2630	4	B	well, they're, they're, they're really very strong academic rather than, you know, big sports,
2630	6	A	yeah,
2630	5	A	that's,
2630	20	A	where, where you at?
2630	4	B	we're outside of, uh, washington in maryland.
2630	1	B	how about you?
2630	14	A	oh, okay,
2630	4	A	i'm in, uh, suburban dallas.
2630	6	B	uh-huh,
2630	13	B	do you have children in,
2630	26	A	no,
2630	4	A	i don't,
2630	4	A	i have a husband .
2630	4	A	we don't have any kids yet.
2630	6	B	okay, um,
2630	2	A	about all i can say is i guess about picking schools, um, i guess, uh, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea.
2630	5	B	well, i, i,
2630	4	B	one of the, the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job
2630	3	A	this is true,
2630	4	B	uh, but what you can't learn, uh, on a job, is a good solid well-, well-rounded education.
2630	3	A	right,
2630	29	A	the humanities, the history, yeah,
2630	3	B	that's right, you know,
2630	4	B	the renaissance man
2630	3	A	right,
2630	3	A	right,
2630	5	A	no,
2630	5	A	no,
2630	5	A	no .
2630	2	B	and, uh, and if you get that you can,
2630	2	B	and if you do well, you can, you can learn a job,
2630	6	A	yeah,
2630	2	A	but they, you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school
2630	3	B	that's exactly right.
2630	7	A	usually a company, it will, if it's worth it's weight, will subsidize,
2630	3	B	that's right.
2630	5	A	and,
2630	4	B	so the advice we gave to them
2630	6	A	uh-huh.
2630	7	B	was, number one, visit the colleges
2630	3	A	this, this is true,
2630	7	B	that you're thinking about
2630	6	A	yes.
2630	7	B	describe first of all, the size school that you might be interested in
2630	24	A	and if you want to go away,
2630	41	A	right,
2630	33	B	do you want to go away,
2630	33	B	how far from home do you want to be.
2630	6	A	right.
2630	33	B	what do you want in a college.
2630	4	B	now my son is a national level competitive swimmer
2630	9	A	good.
2630	4	B	so he wanted to swim in school,
2630	4	B	but he did not want to be in a swim factory.
2630	6	A	okay.
2630	29	A	so he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, they'd, in austin, texas, university of texas,
2630	3	B	that's right,
2630	4	B	that's the university of texas at austin, or
2630	6	A	right.
2630	7	B	stanford or something like that
2630	30	A	texas aqua-,
2630	6	A	yeah,
2630	7	B	so he didn't even consider those.
2630	6	A	okay,
2630	4	A	well that's, i think the other thing is, too, um, i know i went to a, uh, city high school in chicago
2630	6	B	uh-huh.
2630	4	A	and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say, my brother and i were,
2630	4	A	and economics was the choice
2630	6	B	uh-huh.
2630	2	A	um, sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school.
2630	4	B	he is very, very strong academically,
2630	5	B	yeah,
2630	5	B	so, we've just,
2630	4	B	but, you know, he had to look to see
2630	6	A	uh-huh.
2630	7	B	what kind of environment he liked,
2630	4	B	and yet he, he did wind up having to make a choice.
2630	4	B	he did apply to a large, you know, large group,
2630	6	A	yeah,
2630	4	A	university of penn,
2630	4	A	i'm originally from pennsylvania.
2630	4	A	pennsyl-, university of pennsylvania,
2630	4	B	it's got about nine thousand undergraduate.
2630	3	A	yeah,
2630	2	A	that's strong,
2630	5	A	i mean that's
2630	6	B	yeah,
2630	7	A	you know --
2630	6	B	yeah.
2630	2	A	and it's, it's, well, it's a little bit, i don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word i want. um, more diverse ,
2630	3	B	yes,
2630	4	B	and it, but it does have the under, you know,
2630	4	B	that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school, so that the, uh, the college of arts and sciences is, you know, i guess about four thousand.
2630	13	A	at williams or pennsylvania?
2630	13	A	at williams,
2630	4	B	at pennsylvania.
2630	30	A	at pennsylvania.
2630	20	A	well how large is williams?
2630	4	B	williams is an undergraduate school only
2630	6	A	right.
2630	4	B	um, and it's a total of two thousand.
2630	9	A	well that's not bad.
2630	3	B	yeah,
2630	4	B	so he knew the feeling because my other son is at amherst which is
2630	24	A	which is a lot,
2630	7	B	fifteen hundred
2630	6	A	yeah.
2630	4	B	and he had visited his brother at amherst and knew
2630	6	A	uh-huh.
2630	7	B	that he liked the environment
2630	6	A	uh-huh.
2630	4	B	but he did go on college visits,
2630	4	B	and he liked,
2630	2	A	that's the thing to do,
2630	4	A	i mean, i, not having any children, my husband was an ohio state person,
2630	4	A	and, uh, that has something like either the first or second largest student population, like fifty thousand.
2630	3	B	yes,
2630	3	B	yes
2630	4	A	combined .
2630	2	B	it's large,
2630	4	B	and they, both boys had decided no, that they did not want that.
2630	3	A	yeah,
2630	2	A	that is too much,
2630	2	A	and i mean, i, um, i can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at bennington in vermont,
2630	5	B	oh, it's,
2630	5	B	so you,
2630	4	A	um, and that was, this was twenty years ago .
2630	6	B	uh-huh.
2630	4	A	showing my age,
2630	13	B	and did you ever eat at the blue bin diner?
2630	19	A	yes.
2630	9	A	oh my god,
2630	20	A	where are you from,
2630	11	A	well, let's not talk about that .
2630	3	B	no
2630	4	B	but we've been there when whose gone up there.
2630	4	A	it's, um, in that area.
2630	4	A	i mean i just can't say enough about it.
2630	4	B	oh, it's, it
2630	4	B	we went
2630	4	B	and he was, you know, impressed by the clean air
2630	4	B	and he, he met the students at both schools
2630	4	B	and he liked them.
2630	4	A	well you know, um, my husband's an engineer and a strong , a strong liberal arts background with, uh, a graduate degree in a technical field
2630	6	B	uh-huh.
2630	7	A	will get him much further than say like a, a strong, um, business administration degree than with another m b a
2630	3	B	that's it.
2630	7	A	on top of it.
2630	2	B	the thing is if, if a person really knows very early on
2630	6	A	uh-huh.
2630	7	B	that they want to go
2630	24	A	and they usually,
2630	7	B	in a technical field, than you're not, then it's probably good to go to, you know, to apply to a # school #
2630	7	A	# yeah,
2630	2	A	# # but they usually don't. #
2630	7	B	# with a good # technical program,
2630	2	B	but, uh, for, if you're going into,
2630	2	B	if you know engineering is the thing if, then you've got to at least take engineering.
2630	3	A	right,
2630	4	A	but they,
2630	5	A	no
2630	8	A	but who does.
2630	2	A	i mean,   i think,
2630	3	B	# that's right. #
2630	7	A	# i think  # all,  i think  the majority of people just don't know.
2630	5	A	no
2630	4	A	he looked at criteria such as location, size of school
2630	6	B	uh-huh.
2630	7	A	uh,
2630	5	B	no
2630	4	B	he didn't apply to any school further,
2630	4	B	the furthest away was bowdoin, in maine which is about twelve hours.
2630	2	A	that's still pretty far though.
2630	2	A	i mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go,
2630	6	B	yeah,
2630	4	B	that was the furthest and then kenyon in ohio which was about six and a half hours
2630	4	B	and williams is about seven.
2630	9	A	oh, that's not too bad.
2630	3	B	yeah
2630	5	B	so, well, i mean he, so it wasn't,
2630	5	B	he, you know,
2630	4	B	then the university of pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train
2630	4	B	and then bucknell in mid-state pennsylvania.
2630	6	A	yeah,
2630	2	A	he will enjoy williams i think and is a good academic,
2630	3	B	yeah,
2630	4	B	and he will,
2630	4	B	and if, it came down i mean, as he, he came,
2630	4	B	he's been talking to them
2630	4	B	and,
2630	16	A	<Laughter>.
2630	7	B	and  he came down
2630	4	B	and one of the things that he said is, he went to pennsylvania this weekend
2630	4	B	and he had an absolutely marvelous time
2630	6	A	uh-huh.
2630	4	B	he had a great time
2630	4	B	but then he said, you know, it was such a good time that i almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun.
2630	2	A	that could very well be
2630	2	A	and,
2630	4	B	and he said it almost back-,
2630	4	B	i think it backfired.
2630	7	A	so he's developing his, his, uh, internal instincts right now.
2630	2	A	that's good because
2630	5	B	so.
2630	7	A	i mean i'm sure what he said was true, that, uh, you,
2630	4	A	well actually that's one of the reasons i went to ,
2630	2	A	kenyon, he we-, he made a good choice.
2630	4	A	i went,
2630	4	A	i, well i was supposed to,
2630	4	A	but i spent a year in vermont, my freshman year,
2630	4	A	it was just too far away,
2630	4	A	it was too different
2630	6	B	uh-huh.
2630	7	A	uh, the level of income of lot of the students
2630	4	A	and their attitudes was just, um, beyond my,
2630	6	B	# yeah,
2630	6	B	yeah. #
2630	7	A	# um, in # terms of drugs, et cetera, which i thought was shocking.
2630	2	B	of course, that period too was probably difficult.
2630	3	A	right,
2630	3	A	yeah,
2630	2	A	you're right
2630	4	A	but then i went,
2630	4	B	but i did, uh,
2630	4	B	my advice to him,
2630	6	A	yeah.
2630	7	B	and my hus-, was that, uh, he had to really decide what he wanted out of college.
2630	4	B	he had to look at himself.
2630	4	B	uh, in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip
2630	4	B	and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school
2630	6	A	uh-huh.
2630	7	B	where, especially in a kenyon or a williams, where you see the professors around town all the time, you skip class in the morning and they see you,
2630	4	A	and you're going to get a little bit more input than
2630	5	B	that's,
2630	3	B	yeah,
2630	3	B	yeah.
2630	7	A	discipline
2630	5	A	yeah.
2630	4	B	and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you, uh, so that,
2630	4	B	and he will know the professors in a small,
2630	28	A	well i don't know how to put this either in this way
2630	2	A	and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this
2630	2	A	but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, i think the refinement that they get
2630	6	B	uh-huh.
2630	7	A	i don't mean specifically or culture but just what you're saying, just a solid background
2630	6	B	yeah,
2630	6	B	yeah.
2630	7	A	because i just don't think at that age i just don't think that young people know what they want to do.
2630	3	B	that's right,
2630	3	B	that's right.
2630	7	A	you know
2630	5	A	and, um,
2630	4	B	and, um, and it's just the personal contact where if you need help --
2630	3	A	that's right.
2630	5	B	he had,
2630	4	B	i told him to look to yourself.
2630	33	B	are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says i've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred
2630	6	A	# right . #
2630	7	B	# that you're really # going to look him up
2630	6	A	yeah.
2630	33	B	but if it's a class of fifteen
2630	2	A	this is very, very,
2630	7	B	and you need help, you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures
2630	6	A	oh.
2630	4	B	and even though they may break it up into smaller groups penn is known for having
2630	24	A	# they have video lectures. #
2630	7	B	# graduate assistance teaching. #
2630	6	A	yeah.
2630	30	A	# video lectures. #
2630	4	B	# they have # graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups.
2630	3	A	this is true,
2630	2	A	and i mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the,
2630	13	A	did he just make the decision today?
2630	4	B	he made the decision, uh, i'd say, about, uh, an hour and a half ago .
2630	9	A	how funny .
2630	3	B	yeah,
2630	2	B	i mean, that's so funny. i mean,
2630	4	B	and, and, in fact, he had just an hour before that two, uh, recent graduates from kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him
2630	9	A	that's funny.
2630	4	B	and, uh, i mean, and he, they were really nice,
2630	4	B	and, but he said is, that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know,
2630	4	B	but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better.
2630	29	A	it was easy for him to rule out.
2630	29	A	he knew what he didn't want --
2630	3	B	yeah,
2630	3	B	yeah.
2630	2	A	that's exactly,
2630	5	A	yeah.
2630	13	A	now is your other,
2630	4	A	i mean we're talking about what you think,
2630	4	A	but obviously you're experiencing it. uh,
2630	16	B	.
2630	13	A	did your other son, um,
2630	4	B	my other son is just as happy as a bed bug.
2630	0	A	a clam.
2630	5	B	he,
2630	4	B	the moment he knew, he, he decided early on that amherst was the school.
2630	4	B	he's a classical guitarist
2630	9	A	oh, wonderful.
2630	4	B	and he decided, he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate
2630	6	A	uh-huh.
2630	7	B	for classical guitar,
2630	4	B	but he decided he was going to go to  the,  um
2630	24	A	the smaller and the,
2630	7	B	the  smaller now, and then graduate school later.
2630	2	A	and they'll do fine in their studies,
2630	2	A	and i'm sure they'll go on to graduate school,
2630	29	A	and, * i think this should be a slash unit, since a's next utterance follows b's longer turn
2630	4	B	well, he's really, my older boy's real happy,
2630	4	B	and he's minoring in english,
2630	4	B	and he had thought about economics,
2630	4	B	and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't,
2630	7	A	and now he's a sen-, he's a senior / * should be an indep slash unit
2630	15	A	or is this early admissions?
2630	4	B	he's, um, he's going to be a junior.
2630	4	B	he'll be, he's finishing his sophomore year
2630	29	A	so he's,
2630	7	B	so he's double majoring.
2630	7	A	so he's,  yeah,
2630	2	A	well sounds like you have two talented sons.
2630	4	B	well, you know, see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two.
2630	2	A	i think, and a lot of people talk about,
2630	4	A	and it's not the economics i solely zeroed in on,
2630	2	A	but i think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return
2630	6	B	yeah.
2630	2	A	and i think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller coll-, colleges because of that,
2630	2	A	and i think it's rather sad,
2630	4	B	well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college,
2630	4	B	this was our advice, too, irrespective of the cost. that somehow we would manage.
2630	2	A	you are wonderful parents .
2630	4	B	well, we place a real high priority on education in our family.
2630	6	A	no,
2630	3	A	and i agree,
2630	4	A	i mean, my husband and i,
2630	4	A	in fact, i'm taking my l s a t -s, um,
2630	4	A	i'm thirty something
2630	9	B	oh, good,
2630	9	B	that's wonderful.
2630	7	A	and taking my l s a t -s on june tenth.
2630	9	B	oh, that's great.
2630	2	A	the point being, and your sons will learn this from you, i'm sure, that, uh, no matter what age you are, you can learn
2630	3	B	that's right,
2630	3	B	that's exactly,
2630	2	A	and, it sounds like they're going to, you know, they're,
2653	0	A	so i own a, a p c a t at my home.
2653	6	B	uh-huh,
2653	4	B	i could never justify owning a personal computer at home, uh,
2653	2	B	i mean, that's quite an expense to look for, uh,
2653	20	B	well, who is this,
2653	1	B	what do you use yours at home for?
2653	39	A	well, that's actually a good question.
2653	4	A	my wife works out of the home, our home.
2653	4	A	she has an office
2653	4	A	and in fact she sits in the office
2653	4	A	and she uses it to compose and print out letters.
2653	14	B	okay,
2653	5	B	well now.
2653	4	A	so that's a very regular use of it that she has.
2653	6	B	uh-huh.
2653	4	A	and in addition to that i tinker around with it.
2653	4	A	i'm a computer scientist.
2653	14	B	oh.
2653	4	A	and so i write programs to do little things
2653	4	A	i'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special.
2653	4	A	and also i'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like.
2653	4	B	uh, huh, well, excuse me, i, uh, uh, well i'm a technician, electronics tech.
2653	4	B	years ago t i sent me to their, uh, computer school down in austin.
2653	6	A	uh-huh.
2653	4	B	so, uh, i learned to repair one
2653	4	B	but you know i never really learned to operate one.
2653	2	A	oh, that's a key thing.
2653	5	A	well, actually that's a,
2653	2	A	there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today.
2653	3	B	yes.
2653	7	A	that just require no programming.
2653	5	A	so that yo-,
2653	2	A	in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming
2653	2	A	but if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works.
2653	6	B	uh-huh.
2653	2	A	but i think you you really hit the nail on the head.
2653	2	A	for the average person is exactly what he can use it for.
2653	2	A	and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters
2653	2	A	or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the  nuts and bolts in your garage,
2653	2	A	whatever
2653	2	A	there, your issue is then there really,
2653	4	B	well, uh, space is a handicap with me,
2653	4	B	i live in a motor home.
2653	6	A	oh, i see
2653	5	A	well.
2653	4	B	and i'm preparing for retirement.
2653	6	A	i see
2653	9	A	well, congratulations on that.
2653	4	B	and i'm not to far from it another year and a half.
2653	6	A	yeah,
2653	2	A	well, actually one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap.
2653	3	B	yes,
2653	3	B	definitely,
2653	2	B	but just like the computers.
2653	6	A	uh-huh.
2653	4	B	uh, remember how they started out running three, four hundred dollars.
2653	6	A	right.
2653	29	A	oh, the calculators you mean.
2653	23	B	i mean ca-, calculators,
2653	10	B	i beg your pardon.
2653	3	A	yeah,
2653	3	A	they sure do.
2653	3	A	yeah
2653	4	A	i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum.
2653	2	A	you can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars.
2653	18	B	you're kidding.
2653	26	A	no.
2653	13	B	including a printer?
2653	39	A	well, actually i wasn't including a printer,
2653	4	A	but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars
2653	4	A	so make it seven hundred.
2653	13	B	a hundred?
2653	19	A	yeah.
2653	9	B	wholly smoke,
2653	13	B	a respectable one?
2653	19	A	yes,
2653	19	A	uh-huh.
2653	4	B	well, see of not being particularly interested i don't keep track of prices on them,
2653	4	B	but i'm, i'm, that does amaze me.
2653	6	A	yeah,
2653	4	A	the prices had plummeted,
2653	4	A	you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply,
2653	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2653	7	A	# the # box and the mother board of a type of computer called an eighty, eighty-eight, for about two hundred dollars.
2653	6	B	huh.
2653	4	A	and then the keyboard is another fifty,
2653	4	A	the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred
2653	4	A	and then the disk drive is two fifty.
2653	13	B	well, what, what is a a good brand a inexpensive.
2653	39	A	well, that's that's the deal is you're not buying brands now,
2653	4	A	you're buying these knock offs,
2653	5	A	so there's,
2653	4	A	probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called computer shopper.
2653	6	B	uh-huh.
2653	4	A	it's a big magazine,
2653	4	A	it's twelve inches acro-, narrow, the narrow side and
2653	9	B	oh, wow.
2653	7	A	seventeen inches the tall side
2653	4	A	and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages.
2653	4	A	but the book is, the magazine is full of these mail order, computer mail-order houses
2653	4	A	and they're all competing with each.
2653	6	B	uh-huh.
2653	4	A	so you just flip through there until you find a eighty, eighty-eight computer
2653	4	A	that that's called, it's the original p c.
2653	5	A	so it's,
2653	4	A	we call the t i, i'm sorry an i b m p c compatible.
2653	4	A	and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me.
2653	6	B	uh.
2653	4	A	and you mix and match
2653	4	A	and then you do it by mail-order.
2653	4	A	but there's no real brands
2653	4	A	it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board.
2653	14	B	i see.
2653	1	B	how do you go about getting one of those a catalogs?
2653	4	A	they're available in, you know, the b daltons, that that type of thing.
2653	6	B	uh-huh.
2653	4	A	you'll notice that in that it's, it's a, it's a, although it's a magazine it's large.
2653	4	A	and like i said it's about an inch thick .
2653	6	B	uh-huh,
2653	4	B	well, getting back to the p c -s,
2653	21	B	i'll tell you,
2653	5	B	i ya,
2653	4	B	first of all i don't like a machine that's smarter than me.
2653	16	A	<Laughter>.
2653	4	B	and secondly, i did learn this much about computers,
2653	4	B	they they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten.
2653	16	A	<Laughter>.
2653	4	B	in binary.
2653	3	A	that's right .
2653	9	A	there's great.
2653	4	B	well, anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes.
2653	6	A	oh, yeah .
2653	4	B	one and one equals ten.
2653	6	A	yeah,
2653	6	A	that's great.
2653	2	B	course it's it's kind of an inside joke, you know.
2653	6	A	yeah.
2653	2	B	you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary.
2653	9	A	i understand,
2653	9	A	that's great,
2653	9	A	that's a good joke.
2653	5	B	so what,
2653	13	B	do you, uh, uh, work with a computers a at t i?
2653	23	A	i did for years
2653	4	A	and then i was a scientist over in central research labs
2653	4	A	and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing.
2653	6	B	uh-huh.
2653	4	A	uh, now i i type that one,
2653	4	A	but i don't use it anymore.
2653	6	B	uh-huh,
2653	4	B	well i just recently started using one.
2653	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2653	7	B	# in # connection with my work.
2653	6	A	yes.
2653	4	B	uh, i keep track of an inventory here.
2653	6	A	uh-huh.
2653	2	B	and of course now that is where a computer is very handy.
2653	3	A	yes,
2653	3	A	i agree.
2653	4	B	and, well i, it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated.
2653	6	A	oh, yeah.
2653	4	B	see i'm with the q r a lab.
2653	6	A	oh, i see
2653	9	A	that's fascinating.
2653	7	B	qualification and evaluation
2653	4	B	so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated,
2653	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2653	4	B	# and # they're dated.
2653	4	B	so i have to keep up with them, uh,
2653	4	B	and and it's very handy doing it on the computer.
2653	6	A	yeah.
2653	4	B	i just run a printout every week
2653	4	B	and and it puts me right up-to-date what i'm, what i have to do, what i have to ship, what i should be expecting to be returned.
2653	6	A	uh-huh.
2653	5	B	so a,
2653	4	B	it it is handy.
2653	6	A	right.
2653	4	B	and i must admit that up until i did start using one, uh, it was, i had very little interest in computers.
2653	6	A	yes .
2653	2	B	but they are amazing.
2653	3	A	yeah,
2653	3	A	they certainly are.
2653	21	A	so let's see, see
2653	2	A	so i guess with respect to the question,
2653	5	A	yeah,
2653	2	A	i guess we've kind of covered it.
2653	3	B	i think we did.
2653	9	A	great,
2653	12	A	nice little conversation with you jack.
2653	12	B	yeah,
2653	12	B	mike you take care now.
2653	12	A	# good day. #
2653	12	B	# good luck # to you.
2653	12	A	thank you.
2653	12	A	same to you.
2713	4	A	i'm actually at work.
2713	6	B	oh, o-, .
2713	5	A	i-,
2713	4	A	i'm in facilities and happen to have, uh, weekend duty here.
2713	14	B	oh, okay.
2713	20	B	what building do you work in?
2713	4	A	i'm in the south building.
2713	14	B	oh, okay.
2713	14	B	okay.
2713	4	A	we, we pull mostly evenings.
2713	4	A	we are having,
2713	4	A	there's three of us, uh, facilities' managers are covering the off shifts. just to have somebody here, uh, from management to, uh, see if they need anything.
2713	14	B	oh, okay.
2713	14	B	okay.
2713	5	A	oh, the,
2713	20	A	how many calls have you made?
2713	4	B	i've only made a few.
2713	14	A	okay.
2713	5	B	um,
2713	4	A	i'm, uh, getting close to twenty.
2713	5	A	this is the,
2713	4	A	yeah, hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one,
2713	4	A	but i don't really have a lot in this one.
2713	4	A	usually i can talk for hours on most of the subjects they pick .
2713	16	B	<Laughter>.
2713	11	A	go ahead, you first .
2713	3	B	okay,
2713	4	B	our topic for today is invasion of privacy.
2713	4	B	so, i got a good one.
2713	6	A	okay,
2713	9	A	good.
2713	4	B	when the phone rings and you've got a recording, and this always happens like around five or six o'clock,
2713	6	A	# okay, yeah. #
2713	7	B	# at night. # it rings and you get this recording
2713	4	B	and then it won't go away
2713	4	B	and any, any of the type of solicitation that, where they call all the time, you know.
2713	4	B	there are evenings especially friday nights, thursday and friday nights.
2713	4	B	well, we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night.
2713	4	B	more people call, that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall, you know, your sitting down to eat and the phone rings
2713	4	B	and,
2713	3	A	# right. #
2713	7	B	# it's # like, i don't want anything, thank you very much .
2713	3	A	yeah,
2713	5	A	i,
2713	4	A	the worst one, i guess, is like you, when it's a recording. i thin-, i don't mind so much someone calls
2713	4	A	and it's a, and it's a salesperson, at least you can chat or whatever and say, okay, now, we want to go ,
2713	4	A	and then  when, when they actually start off with a, a computer,
2713	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2713	7	A	# and # expect you to talk to a computer, uh, that's where i draw the lin-, i just hang up immediately, you know.
2713	3	B	uh-huh.
2713	3	B	oh, yeah.
2713	21	A	uh, shut my other radio off here .
2713	6	B	yeah,
2713	4	B	that's, that's real irritating to me.
2713	4	A	uh, i guess they get their name-,
2713	4	A	i'm, i'm amazed the question about that the,
2713	4	A	my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine
2713	4	A	and i have one too,
2713	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2713	4	A	# and # they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long, if they catch your answering machine,
2713	29	B	they can leave their whole spiel on it.
2713	3	A	yeah,
2713	4	A	they, they can erase all your others, you know, because if you have,
2713	4	A	i think that's the way it is, no, mine, i guess, if it's full, it will not take it, i'm not sure.
2713	4	A	but they can certainly, uh, block your answering machine so someone else calls you, uh, and your answering machine is full, you know,
2713	6	B	# huh. #
2713	7	A	# it # won't erase.
2713	6	B	yeah
2713	5	B	i,
2713	3	A	but your right. / *your - you're
2713	2	A	that was a good one.
2713	3	B	yeah,
2713	4	B	that's, that's a high irritant for me.
2713	4	B	drives me crazy.
2713	4	B	and it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them.
2713	6	A	uh-huh.
2713	4	B	and so it really, really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not, you know, you have a unlisted number or not.
2713	4	B	and they pass around, uh, cards that have everybody's name on it.
2713	4	B	like if you order something through a mail order catalog,
2713	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2713	7	B	# you # know, then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in. and a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list,
2713	4	B	or they sell their catalog list of people,
2713	6	A	# yeah. #
2713	7	B	# to # different companies and everything.
2713	4	A	i've got one, it's not really an invasion of privacy / * 2 slash units?
2713	4	A	but it's, uh, annoyance for me in the office with, uh, speaker phones.
2713	5	A	you know, i,
2713	5	A	the-,
2713	2	A	they're great for an office
2713	4	A	but this one guy next to me, who's not here just so i could talk about him,
2713	16	B	# . #
2713	7	A	# he # uses his speaker phone all the time,
2713	4	A	and it carries over
2713	4	A	and so not only would you hear,
2713	2	A	it seems to me that you talk longer from wh-, you kind of yell into it.
2713	3	B	right.
2713	3	B	right.
2713	4	A	uh, and so he yells into it,
2713	4	A	and you hear the other person too,
2713	4	A	so it's kind of a double annoyance.
2713	4	A	he actually, uh, ruins my privacy you might say because the, the t i offices are so open anyway.
2713	6	B	uh-huh,
2713	6	B	uh-huh.
2713	7	A	uh, that i'm amazed that, the fact that i'm about ready to say something, uh, if he's even thought of that that's a real uncourteous thing, an, an invasion of everyone else's time and, and concentration to just be loud.
2713	4	A	i don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and, and annoying, you know.
2713	4	A	uh, that's,
2713	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2713	7	A	# perhaps # not quite an invasion of privacy
2713	2	A	but i think it is,
2713	5	A	and yo-,
2713	4	A	we both picked phone items there.
2713	3	B	oh, yeah.
2713	3	B	oh, yeah.
2713	11	A	go ahead, do you have any more? / * seems to be 2 slash units
2713	21	B	let's see, i'm trying to think.
2713	13	B	oh, have you heard that, that, i'm trying to think of what company it was, there was a company that was going to, uh, be giving out information about your financial status.
2713	19	A	oh, yeah,
2713	2	A	that's, that's a good one too. yeah, / * shouldn't that "yeah" be an indep. slash unit?
2713	16	B	# . #
2713	4	A	# i # heard something about, not that exactly,
2713	11	A	but go ahead.
2713	4	B	well, um, i work in the computer science center
2713	4	B	and so we hear a lot about things that are, that computers are capable of doing.
2713	6	A	yeah.
2713	4	B	and, uh, this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have x amount of million peoples financial history and information on it.
2713	4	B	and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera, et cetera.
2713	6	A	uh-huh.
2713	4	B	and, uh, they finally, uh, stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused,
2713	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2713	7	B	# because # it was such a big deal.
2713	4	B	and i wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either.
2713	4	B	i mean, there was a lot of stuff going on about it.
2713	4	A	well, i, uh, heard something similar to that.
2713	4	A	i listen to,
2713	4	A	i'm a, uh, uh, talk show person.
2713	5	A	and there was,
2713	6	B	# okay. #
2713	4	A	# when # i, when i do my chores up at the rad-,
2713	4	A	i'm a radio person i guess is what i mean.
2713	6	B	uh-huh.
2713	4	A	and so i listened to, was it five seventy, which has continuous talk on the weekends,
2713	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2713	7	A	# and # neil sperry and everybody, i mean, the lawyers and veterinarians and all that.
2713	4	A	and, uh, i don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a fin-, a financial application, all that information on there is really not necessarily,
2713	4	A	even a, your social security number, you know, they,
2713	6	B	# huh. #
2713	7	A	# you # should just put down the basics and put n a, where you don't want to answer.
2713	6	B	uh-huh.
2713	4	A	whether it's your personal salary or whatever.
2713	4	A	uh, if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down
2713	4	A	and i was curious as to w-, you know, what specific things you, you did have to put down.
2713	6	B	huh.
2713	4	A	but he says social security, you don't need to put that down there. which i thought was surprising.
2713	4	A	so maybe there's something along that same line where, you know, in all these financial, uh, applications that you make out, you don't have to put all that stuff down there.
2713	4	A	it would be nice to know what's, what was,
2713	4	A	of course, of course, they could say, well, i can't give you a card,
2713	4	A	and you could say, fine,
2713	4	A	but, you know, some things will be private, you know,
2713	4	A	but he said just put n a
2713	4	A	and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money , they want your card.
2713	16	B	<Laughter>.
2713	4	A	but if you don't feel like putting it down, just put n a, you know.
2713	6	B	uh-huh.
2713	9	B	well, that's real interesting.
2713	4	B	i know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need,
2713	6	A	# yeah,
2713	6	A	yeah. #
2713	7	B	# on several # things and, you know, your credit ap and th-, all, all they ever need you to do is give them permission to, to pull a credit thing on, on yourself
2713	4	B	and there it is.
2713	4	B	that's all they really care about.
2713	6	A	yeah.
2713	4	B	they just want that credit history to see if you're a person.
2713	4	B	if you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that.
2713	4	A	i haven't,
2713	4	A	i don't have any friends down at the, the austin plant,
2713	4	A	but i heard that they were really upset about the drug thing,
2713	4	A	and we seem to up here have just breezed through that
2713	4	A	and apparently some other companies are having trouble
2713	4	A	that, i don't have any trouble with it.
2713	4	A	uh, it's kind of unusual here we are in dallas, you know, the biggest location and, and it just breezed through
2713	4	A	and wasn't really, no one was, i guess, was really too concerned about it, uh, yet in austin, there, there were, whether it was a class action or how far it got, i don't really know because t i only had a few things on t i news i think about it,
2713	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2713	7	A	# that # they were objecting to
2713	5	A	but the,
2713	4	A	some people object to that which i don't mind, no problem at all, you know.
2713	4	B	oh, i know that there's several people i've talked to that really have a problem with it
2713	4	B	and,
2713	6	A	# huh. #
2713	7	B	# i'm # former military
2713	4	B	so you get kind of used  to,
2713	6	A	# yeah,
2713	6	A	right. #
2713	7	B	# to  going # through stuff like that.
2713	4	B	you know, you don't pay any attention to it. i mean,
2713	6	A	# right. #
2713	4	B	# once # you sign over your soul to uncle sam,
2713	16	A	# . #
2713	7	B	# # , you know, you just  kind of,
2713	3	A	# i know. #
2713	7	B	# kind of  # blow it off
2713	5	B	but ,
2713	3	A	i know, yeah.
2713	4	A	i served my time too, yeah.
2713	4	B	so, i think, i think the people who have, who have been down that route or have had it, to deal with anything like that have learned, you know, it's just one of those things.
2713	4	B	you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it.
2713	6	A	yeah.
2713	4	B	but i do know that there are several sites .
2713	5	B	i didn't,
2713	4	B	i wasn't aware that austin was one of them,
2713	4	B	but i think johnson city was one.
2713	13	A	oh, did they object too?
2713	19	B	yeah,
2713	4	B	there's, there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue.
2713	6	A	uh-huh.
2713	7	B	and the, but also on things that i'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that there were people, uh, there were, the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too.
2713	6	A	yeah,
2713	4	A	well, i'm, i'm all for it.
2713	5	A	i,
2713	4	A	uh, it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or, you know, carry it to wherever you want to carry it really, uh,
2713	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2713	7	A	# uh, # of course, that would really be a big thing in a public school
2713	4	A	but, uh, i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it.
2713	4	A	uh, uh, and i think it is, they, they found that it's been very low really.
2713	6	B	uh-huh.
2713	4	A	i guess maybe at the locations though, i don't know if they have it done but, done it by location.
2713	2	A	i don't really know if, uh, they need to publish that really.
2713	2	B	oh, i don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and, , on an individual basis.
2713	3	A	right.
2713	2	B	i mean,
2713	3	A	# right. #
2713	7	B	# if # they're going to do it, just deal with it and,
2713	3	A	# right. #
2713	7	B	# be # done with it.
2713	2	A	but i think that was an actu-, actually a good thing that happened, uh, i never considered it, i guess, it's an invasion of your privacy
2713	2	A	but it's something that is for the good of so many people, you know, to,
2713	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2713	7	A	# have # everyone, uh, take the test right away
2713	4	A	and, uh, and hopefully, maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that, well, uh, i might as well get off, you know, if i want to stay so, you know,
2713	2	B	# oh,  i,  #
2713	7	A	# if that # was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good.
2713	7	B	oh, i  think it's a safety factor too because, you know, when people are inebriated, whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever, they are very unsafe for the, their co-workers, you know,
2713	3	A	# oh, sure. #
2713	7	B	# it's like, # you know, my father was a fireman
2713	4	B	and i can just imagine if, you know, , you know, some guy being on drugs they go there
2713	4	B	and,
2713	6	A	# right. #
2713	7	B	# and,  # you know, you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you
2713	4	B	and they fall, they fall out because of the drug issue,
2713	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2713	7	B	# you # know. i mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that, that you can understand / * seems that there should be a slash after 'you know'
2713	2	B	but the use of drugs or anything like that,
2713	6	A	# right. #
2713	7	B	# will, # uh, be a problem.
2713	11	A	go ahead, you got me more, i, - / * 2 slash units?
2713	4	A	this is, this is a tough one, i don't, really haven't thought about any of this.
2713	16	B	<Laughter>.
2713	4	A	they had gardening yesterday and all the repairs,
2713	5	A	and, boy, i could,
2755	4	A	so, child care, your views.
2755	4	B	uh, well, we only have one child right now and another one on the way
2755	4	B	and right now i'm, i'm all with her during the day.
2755	5	B	i,
2755	4	B	if i was looking for outside care i probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find, if i was close to home, relatives or people with it is same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes as, as parents.
2755	20	A	and what religious faith?
2755	4	B	uh, latter day saints.
2755	9	A	oh
2755	4	B	so
2755	7	A	that's, that's good.
2755	7	B	so  that's what i would try to do.
2755	4	B	with a teaching background i've, um, had a little bit of experience with the child day care type situations
2755	4	B	but i've seen some good ones
2755	4	B	and i've seen some really bad ones.
2755	13	A	uh, they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they?
2755	19	B	uh-huh,
2755	4	B	and everything in between, yeah, in most states there's nothing to regulate them, / * this would seem to be 2 or even 3 slash units
2755	2	A	# and, #
2755	5	B	# and # so,
2755	7	A	whenever they are they seem to regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good.
2755	3	B	right.
2755	2	B	by trying to get them to conform to concern standards they, uh, kind of, uh, eliminate a lot of the, uh,
2755	24	A	better situations.
2755	3	B	yeah.
2755	5	B	the, the, uh,
2755	22	B	what am i trying to think of that,  not the imagination but the creativity in, in the situation
2755	5	B	and so,
2755	3	A	yeah,
2755	3	A	yeah
2755	2	A	that's, that's very well phrased.
2755	16	B	<Laughter>.
2755	13	A	uh, so, have you ever used outside child care?
2755	26	B	no,
2755	36	B	i haven't.
2755	4	B	we've had like people come in and baby-sit for an hour or two
2755	4	B	but i've never had, um,
2755	24	A	real day care.
2755	3	B	right.
2755	4	B	she's, she's not even a year yet,
2755	4	B	so,
2755	5	A	# uh #
2755	7	B	# we haven't # been in, you know, a lot of need yet.
2755	4	A	our step daughter's ten now
2755	6	B	uh-huh.
2755	4	A	and most of the day care has been provide for by grandma.
2755	4	B	i like that situation, that's usually real good . / * 2 slash units?
2755	4	A	but, quite honestly what i believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up, the pass of woodland park
2755	6	B	uh-huh.
2755	7	A	there was, uh, ex-school teacher that, uh, did a small amount of before school and after school, you know, kindergartners, or half dayers
2755	6	B	uh-huh.
2755	7	A	in her home
2755	4	A	and they would read and play,
2755	29	B	# have a relative struct-, a structured, #
2755	5	A	# seem to be, #
2755	7	B	activities and not just, you know, stick them in a corner and say you're on your own.
2755	3	A	uh, yeah,
2755	4	A	and, uh, despite our beliefs, she was, uh, one of the more, uh,  charismatic christian faiths
2755	6	B	uh-huh.
2755	4	A	and it worked out wonderfully.
2755	6	B	yeah.
2755	2	B	i know that, uh, that i guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that, uh, i don't know if the resources are the proper term, you know, just the, the know, knowledge of who's a available, then you could probably find some really good care.
2755	3	A	uh, yeah,
2755	4	A	but i don't know that it would be state approved.
2755	3	B	that's true.
2755	4	B	you can get somebody maybe willing to baby-sit
2755	4	B	but actual, you know, that's sometimes different, done on a different scale.
2755	4	B	i have even considered, you know, baby-sitting myself, i have a teaching degree, and, uh, thought well, you know, i could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to,
2755	4	B	but i think if you take more than three children in, well,
2755	4	B	that was how it was this virginia, we've recently moved here to texas, but in virginia i think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed.
2755	5	A	i,
2755	4	A	now i don't know what the current texas laws are
2755	4	A	but i, but i do know that the license doesn't seem to, uh,  guarantee quality.
2755	6	B	yeah,
2755	4	B	a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel, file for it just like a business.
2755	4	B	you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i don't,
2755	4	A	uh, now here i believe that child care meets, by in large, certain standards for, uh, balanced food, if they provide food, cleanliness,  and levels of supervision
2755	6	B	uh-huh.
2755	7	A	levels being defined as number of working adults for number of children
2755	6	B	uh-huh.
2755	0	A	but, * i'd definitely call this an incomplete slash unit.
2755	2	B	that's, uh, kind of a minimum there that you're getting.
2755	2	B	your covering basic care there and not all the extras that most people would like to see done with there children, you know, like the educational activities, the supervised play and so forth.
2755	7	A	yeah, / * see note on a.49 above
2755	4	A	uh, my wife is, uh, agnostic
2755	4	A	and i'm, uh, a backsliding presbyterian
2755	4	B	i like that term .
2755	4	A	and, uh,  get, i really believe that this charismatic care, or the charismatic belief when emphasized on care, or semi charismatic i might say
2755	6	B	uh-huh.
2755	7	A	was quite good.
2755	3	B	yeah,
2755	29	B	it was a good influence for your daughter, uh.
2755	3	A	yes,
2755	3	A	very
2755	9	B	well, that's good.
2755	2	A	and, and, uh,  the care is what i guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child.
2755	3	B	uh-huh.
2755	3	B	yeah,
2755	2	B	a little bit of love and, and attention is what most of them need.
2755	2	B	you know, even if it's not a real educated program you can have good educational program
2755	5	B	and, and,
2755	24	A	and not have any care.
2755	3	B	right.
2755	2	B	and, and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself
2755	5	B	and so,
2755	4	A	and i'm not sure that really child care per se should instill any education per se.
2755	13	A	do you know had a i'm saying?
2755	2	B	well, even educated play, uh, supervised play, can teach without,
2755	4	B	and i'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or, or, or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills
2755	5	B	and, uh, uh, you know, like my, my child that,
2755	4	B	she want be an only child for long,
2755	4	B	but, you know, she was an only child,
2755	4	B	or maybe your daughter,
2755	29	A	# proper interface. #
2755	7	B	# not having, #
2755	3	B	yeah,
2755	3	B	yeah,
2755	5	B	just,
2755	4	A	it's just, just correctness of, of  social skills, if you will.
2755	3	B	right,
2755	29	B	those basic things that, uh,  they would, that, you know, you would be a little bit of, uh, i don't know if manners is a good term or not but,
2755	16	A	# . #
2755	7	B	# you # know, dealing with other through proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth, you know, that sort of thing, you'd want your child to learn that, from the experience of someone else, certainly you wouldn't want your child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this, do that, you know, you'd want them it promote politeness and niceness, you know, the things that you would want any child to learn
2755	5	B	and,
2755	16	A	# . #
2755	7	B	# the # reason,
2755	4	B	that's done through example, you know, not an actual sit down learn situation
2755	5	B	so,
2755	6	A	uh, yeah,
2755	2	A	uh, it's a very broad issue.
2755	3	B	uh-huh,
2755	2	B	it is .
2755	2	A	and,  you know, it's a shame
2755	4	A	but most people doing, child care earn almost no money.
2755	4	A	they operate at, you know,
2755	4	A	the owner of the chi-, of a, you know, a large child care facility now,
2755	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2755	4	A	# we're # not talking somebody that does six kids,
2755	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2755	7	A	# in # their home or three or whatever.
2755	29	B	somebody that doesn't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it.
2755	29	B	you mean somebody that has an actual establishment.
2755	3	A	right.
2755	6	B	yeah.
2755	4	A	their employees earn almost nothing.
2755	3	B	yeah.
2755	4	B	i know i, i did that for summer
2755	4	B	so i can, i can vouch for that .
2755	2	A	and that's really, really a shame too because,
2755	13	A	do you and your husband both work.
2755	26	B	no,
2755	4	B	just he does i'm, i'm here during the day with her.
2755	9	A	well, that's wonderful if, if you can make it that way.
2755	4	B	well, we, we decided to,
2755	4	B	we live on a lesser budget so that we have
2755	4	B	that, that's more important to us, you know, as, as, uh, there may come a time when i will be working again, you know,
2755	4	B	but right now that's what we've chosen
2755	4	B	and we wanted to have several,
2755	4	B	we got her
2755	4	B	and we've got another on the way,
2755	2	A	# well, #
2755	7	B	# and # maybe another,
2755	7	A	like i said,
2755	7	B	one soon after that,
2755	5	B	so ,
2755	7	A	that's grand if, if you can pull it off
2755	6	B	right.
2755	2	A	but more and more we're being forced into a situation, we as americans are being forced into a situation, where you've got to have,
2772	0	A	all right.
2772	6	B	okay.
2772	11	B	well, i can go ahead and start and tell you mine
2772	5	B	and,
2772	3	A	okay.
2772	4	B	we're from san antonio
2772	4	B	and that's where i grew up,
2772	5	A	# oh, #
2772	4	B	# so # i was used to the heat, out here right now,
2772	6	A	# yeah. #
2772	4	B	# gosh, # it gets to about seventies, high seventies
2772	4	B	and it gets very cold at night.
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	and monterey it's, um, right on the coast.
2772	4	B	and, i don't know if your familiar with california coastline, / *your - you're
2772	4	B	but we're we're about two hours, about a two hour drive south of san francisco,
2772	14	A	oh, okay.
2772	4	B	and it's, uh, really nice.
2772	4	B	it's a big area for people to come from the different, uh, countries, mostly like japan, germany and england.
2772	4	B	and they usually go to carmel and vacation on the beaches,
2772	4	B	so it's, it's pretty nice, uh, year round.
2772	4	B	but, uh, cool, always cool in the evenings. and warm, warm in the summer,
2772	4	B	but it's stays pretty cold even, uh, during the winter, for as nice as it is.
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	and, um, we usually get a fog. uh, right about, i guess, about four o'clock
2772	4	B	and it kind of rolls in over the coast.
2772	4	B	and, uh, then it usually breaks back off again the next morning.
2772	4	B	and if you go just a little bit ways in, i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards salinas,
2772	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2772	7	B	# uh, # the weather completely changes
2772	4	B	and it gets very hot and dry
2772	4	B	and the fog never makes it that far.
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	but along here it's, uh, very , very different from the texas type weather.
2772	20	B	what's it like down there?
2772	4	A	well, right now we're we're having the little bit of spring that we have.
2772	6	B	oh, really,
2772	2	B	well at least you've got some .
2772	4	A	we don't have many seasons here.
2772	4	A	it goes from winter to summer, usually.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	A	spring usually consists of a lot of rain. especially thunderstorms.
2772	4	A	we've got, we had one of those blow through tonight.
2772	9	B	oh, well, that's good.
2772	4	A	and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	5	A	so.
2772	13	B	have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree,
2772	4	A	it's gotten up to, uh, ninety a couple of times.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	A	but, basically, it's been in the low seventies and eighties.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	2	B	women, that's good. for this time of year.
2772	3	A	yeah.
2772	4	A	it's not really been too bad.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	A	usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	13	B	so do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year?
2772	19	A	yeah,
2772	4	A	quite a bit.
2772	6	B	oh, uh-huh.
2772	4	A	well, the season is just about over for that,
2772	4	A	uh, in fact we drove down to corpus last week
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	A	and, uh, there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way.
2772	4	B	oh, i miss that .
2772	4	A	drove through san antonio
2772	4	A	and i spoke to somebody else this morning from san antonio
2772	5	A	and were,
2772	5	A	they had,
2772	4	A	and we came back.
2772	22	A	what day was that, sunday evening,
2772	4	A	and they had a big rainstorm come through there, part of the same thing we're getting now, i guess.
2772	4	B	oh. oh, well that's real nice because i can remember two years ago that in about february the hundred degree weather started in san antonio and just continued.
2772	4	B	at least y'all are getting some rain up in dallas.
2772	4	B	i'm glad to hear that .
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	4	A	that's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy spring.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	A	we had a pretty rainy fall last year, as well.
2772	13	B	y'all weren't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you?
2772	4	A	um, we've had a few down here, but not anything like kansas.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	A	but this is the season for that.
2772	9	B	oh, gosh.
2772	4	A	they do, they do pop up occasionally,
2772	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2772	7	A	# around # here.
2772	6	B	oh . yeah.
2772	4	B	i really don't miss all the heat there.
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	4	B	i'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings
2772	4	B	so we get a bit of a relief.
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	4	A	i'm from here originally,
2772	4	A	so when it's july and august, i'm pretty well used to the,
2772	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2772	7	A	# hundred # degree temperatures.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	6	B	yeah .
2772	4	A	the biggest problem with, with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil.
2772	4	A	it's that black clay soil.
2772	13	B	oh. is that what dallas is,
2772	0	B	# okay.
2772	5	B	yeah. #
2772	4	A	# you know, it's # not sandy like most of the state is,
2772	4	A	so it doesn't absorb the water real well.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	A	you know, once it rains a little bit, it's, it's filled up and everything else just runs off,
2772	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2772	0	A	# you # know.
2772	6	B	yeah.
2772	4	B	san antonio has that same problem when the rains come.
2772	4	B	it's, it's a complete mess, everything floods, all the under passes.
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	13	B	i didn't realize that dallas had that same problem.
2772	19	A	yeah.
2772	4	A	we have it,
2772	4	A	especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years.
2772	4	A	and there's a section in south dallas that's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	well, we could use some rain up here.
2772	4	B	we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought,
2772	6	A	# really. #
2772	7	B	# up # here
2772	4	B	and they had a pretty good early spring
2772	4	B	and we got quite a bit of rain,
2772	4	B	but it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years.
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	and, uh, so they're still talking water rationing this summer,
2772	4	B	so it would seem strange because in san antonio,
2772	4	B	we had lived out, um, west of san antonio, in castroville,
2772	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2772	4	B	# and # the water in medina lake and that area was really going down, that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing
2772	4	B	and i thought oh, gee i'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the california pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers
2772	33	B	and there's no problem with water.
2772	4	B	and then i came here and found out they were in the, you know, four year draught .
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	so i said, well, gee, this is pretty much like texas.
2772	4	B	and it pretty much is in the middle of summer.
2772	4	B	they have rolling hills around here
2772	4	B	but,
2772	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2772	7	B	# um, # they turn to golden dead grass,
2772	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2772	7	B	# for # the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green.
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	4	B	but, um, it's a really nice area.
2772	4	B	it's just, it's just such a change from, uh, texas because i had grown up with, uh, the heat,
2772	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2772	4	B	# and # used to essentially,
2772	4	B	like you said, you have the cold winter
2772	4	B	and then you have the hot summer spring .
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	and, uh, to come here, it's kind of the temperate weather all year round.
2772	4	B	it's kind of like, uh, spring, i guess, if you, year round, except,
2772	4	B	and then in the winter
2772	4	B	and then it seems sort of like a san antonio early winter or fall,
2772	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2772	7	B	# year-round. #
2772	4	B	so it seems like we only have two springs which is, or two seasons
2772	4	B	and that would be spring and fall.
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	4	B	we never really get any of the other ones.
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	but it's a really nice, uh, change of pace.
2772	4	A	i guess i'd prefer that .
2772	6	B	yeah.
2772	24	B	to the heat.
2772	4	B	i really don't miss the heat.
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	4	B	um, we do a lot of, you know,
2772	4	B	when you do a lot of outside, like running and stuff, it's just so much easier,
2772	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2772	7	B	# up # here
2772	4	B	and you don't have to worry about the high humidity.
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	13	B	does dallas get high humidity?
2772	15	B	or is it pretty dry.
2772	4	A	it's pretty dry.
2772	4	A	we get some when it's this rainy,
2772	4	A	but it's nothing like, i guess, san antonio summers,
2772	4	A	it's nothing like houston.
2772	16	A	
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	A	or east texas, is a little more humid.
2772	6	B	yeah.
2772	4	B	it seems like san antonio is increasing in humidity over the years,
2772	4	B	because i had lived in san antonio for about twenty years,
2772	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2772	4	B	# and # it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid, more and more humid .
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	7	B	and here it's, uh, well it's right by the ocean,
2772	4	B	but, um, it's not the same as corpus.
2772	4	B	corpus, you get that humid salty feeling in the air.
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	but here, um, well the water is extremely cold, up here,
2772	4	B	you can lay on the beach all you want,
2772	4	B	but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming, you have to wear a wet suit.
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	7	B	and a thick wet suit at that, because it's just extremely cold
2772	5	B	and i,
2772	4	B	for some reason, because of the cold, uh, ocean, uh, water, the air is always cool.
2772	4	B	it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling,
2772	4	B	so i really like that about this area.
2772	4	B	and, uh, we just hadn't expected it,
2772	4	B	we were used to, what, uh, gulf coast weather was like,
2772	6	A	# yeah. #
2772	7	B	# when # we came here to pacific coast weather.
2772	4	B	it's just completely different
2772	4	B	and it's much nicer.
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	29	A	probably the pacific breezes make a lot of difference,
2772	3	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	it does
2772	4	B	and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region.
2772	5	B	but you, um,
2772	4	B	but we like it
2772	4	B	so it's a nice change.
2772	4	B	so we'll be here a couple of years
2772	4	B	and we thought well, we'll take advantage of it and see what all the pacific coast is like.
2772	9	A	that's nice.
2772	4	B	so it's been good.
2772	4	A	well, my wife's originally from virginia
2772	4	A	and we lived there for about nine months
2772	4	A	and that was a real change for me.
2772	9	B	oh, i imagine.
2772	13	B	virginia, i imagine, gets real humid, doesn't it?
2772	4	A	um, parts do.
2772	4	A	we, we're over in the western edge in the mountains.
2772	6	B	oh.
2772	4	A	and, they have, of course, some pretty severe storms, winter storms, snow and that type of thing.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	A	but they're so good about clearing the roads, that, you know, it doesn't usually bother you very much.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	6	B	yeah .
2772	29	B	not like texas where everything comes to a stand still.
2772	3	A	yeah.
2772	4	A	their springs and summers are pretty mild, too.
2772	4	A	it never gets real, real hot.
2772	6	B	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	i'll have to try that out because i had heard that north carolina was sort of like that.
2772	6	A	uh-huh.
2772	4	B	and, uh, i've just never really been in that region of the country
2772	4	B	and i guess i'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like.
2772	4	B	because a lot of people that are from that north carolina region really like it.
2772	4	B	and, uh, they get the snow,
2772	4	B	but they said it doesn't really get messy
2772	4	B	and it doesn't really hang around that long.
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	4	B	so, they, the people i know that are from there, uh, they always miss it
2772	4	B	and they want to go back .
2772	4	B	nothing seems quite as good.
2772	5	B	but, anyway. well,
2772	4	A	well, as we were talking the weather came on
2772	4	A	and there's a flash flood watch and,
2772	9	B	# oh, gee-whiz. #
2772	7	A	# more rain # for the next three or four days.
2772	9	B	oh, gosh.
2772	4	B	well, i hope it moves up this way,
2772	2	B	but i'm sure it won't .
2772	6	A	yeah.
2772	4	A	maybe we can send you some .
2772	6	B	yeah.
2772	4	B	because we could sure use it.
2772	13	B	well, you think that takes care of the time and,
2772	23	A	i think that will do it.
2772	3	B	okay.
2772	12	B	well, i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in texas and, uh,
2772	12	A	well, i enjoyed talking with you lisa,
2772	12	B	yeah.
2772	12	B	good luck to you.
2772	12	A	uh-huh.
2772	12	A	you, too.
2772	12	B	okay.
2772	12	B	we'll see you.
2772	12	A	bye.
2772	12	B	bye.
2776	0	B	okay.
2776	9	A	great.
2776	4	A	um, currently, i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	i'm mainly do a lot of walking.
2776	4	A	i have a son that's a little bit overweight
2776	4	A	and, um, the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around.
2776	4	A	so my wife and i kind of take turns.
2776	4	A	at one time i had a fairly regular exercise program.
2776	4	A	but, in the last couple of months i've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down.
2776	4	A	all this space that normally would be dedicated towards the,
2776	6	B	yeah.
2776	7	A	exercise area, is covered in boxes.
2776	20	B	um, what did you do when you did exercise regularly?
2776	4	A	well, i had, uh, a little routine that i did for warm ups.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	and then i did some very mild, say, light weight lifting.
2776	4	A	nothing,
2776	4	A	i'm not trying to make big bulging muscles,
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	7	A	just trying to try and stay as firm as i can stay in my old age .
2776	6	B	yeah
2776	4	B	. um, right now, um, i try when it's nice out,
2776	4	B	it's been raining a lot this spring,
2776	4	B	but i try to, uh,
2776	4	B	i have a bicycle
2776	4	B	and i like to cycle a lot.
2776	4	B	and, uh, my husband and i, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in texas,
2776	4	B	i don't know,
2776	6	A	huh-uh.
2776	7	B	if it's up north,
2776	4	B	but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally
2776	4	B	and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun.
2776	6	A	huh-uh.
2776	4	B	um, so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that.
2776	4	B	and, um, t i, where i work has, uh, a fitness center
2776	4	B	so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill,
2776	4	B	and, um, they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on.
2776	4	B	so i try to,
2776	4	B	i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis.
2776	4	B	i used to, uh, get into it and get out of it based on my schedule,
2776	4	B	so i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now,
2776	2	B	but it's a big commitment.
2776	4	B	we don't have any kids yet
2776	4	B	so, that's a lot of, part of it.
2776	6	A	yeah.
2776	2	A	that's a plus.
2776	4	A	oh, i have a total of five children.
2776	4	A	i have three left living at home.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	and they do take up a big part of my, uh, my evening and weekend.
2776	6	B	yeah.
2776	2	A	and it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too.
2776	6	B	yeah.
2776	2	A	it's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.
2776	3	A	yes,
2776	2	A	when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children.
2776	6	B	huh-uh .
2776	16	A	<Laughter>.
2776	4	B	that's why, they, uh, really stress, at t i, they really stress, staying in shape, like stay in fit, overall fitness, you know, no smoking and all that.
2776	4	B	but it's hard to find, uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you know, because like i know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes
2776	4	B	and i don't know if that would work for me because i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain.
2776	2	B	but it's really hard to find something that works, and, you know, to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever.
2776	2	B	i think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever.
2776	6	A	yeah.
2776	6	B	yeah.
2776	2	A	you have to,
2776	2	A	what i found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	2	A	and you can use what ever rationale you want,
2776	2	A	but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live.
2776	3	B	right.
2776	2	A	and, uh, you know, if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well, then i'll around a lot longer,
2776	16	B	
2776	2	A	and those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where i would have been if i wouldn't have taken it.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	2	A	if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine.
2776	6	B	yeah.
2776	4	B	um, i've been learning a lot lately about, um,
2776	4	B	i've been reading a book by kenneth cooper,
2776	13	B	i don't know if you're familiar with him
2776	6	A	huh-uh.
2776	4	B	he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really.
2776	4	B	he's, he's, kind of, he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing.
2776	4	B	um, he was talking about the three things you could, that cause aging smoking are inactivity, / * mistranscribed? listen
2776	4	B	and what was the other one, i think was, yeah, obesity.
2776	4	B	if you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, you know, cause those are risk factors,
2776	4	B	so anyway,
2776	6	A	yeah.
2776	7	B	it's kind of a tip.
2776	4	A	oh, i've done a lot of study over the years
2776	4	A	and i found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water.
2776	6	B	really .
2776	6	A	yeah.
2776	4	A	um, the research that i've done
2776	4	A	and i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	and, it's amazing, that, uh, you know, prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	there were none prior to nineteen-hundred.
2776	4	A	well, in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. in nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities,
2776	4	A	and after that  we,
2776	16	B	.
2776	7	A	we  started having the hearts attacks
2776	4	A	and, uh, dr. price wrote a book coronary, cholesterol, and chlorine.
2776	4	A	you can usually find it in a health food store.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	i know they had it in health food stores in plano,
2776	4	A	i used live in plano.
2776	32	B	dr. price?
2776	4	A	uh, dr. price,
2776	5	A	yeah.
2776	4	A	and it's amazing,
2776	4	A	he makes the,
2776	4	A	you know, it's a very small book
2776	4	A	and the guys very opinionated,
2776	4	A	um, but he makes a very good case against chlorine.
2776	4	A	there were no heart attacks before we started using it
2776	4	A	and he points out that people in, uh, england
2776	4	A	and, uh, or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks.
2776	7	B	that's really interesting.
2776	6	A	yeah.
2776	4	A	he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	7	A	and, uh, proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis, which is the,
2776	6	B	yeah.
2776	7	A	clogging of the arteries.
2776	5	A	and, uh, you know, he's,
2776	4	A	there's been a lot of reports since then.
2776	4	A	this whole thing about,
2776	4	A	first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol,
2776	4	A	and now they're saying what's cholesterol,
2776	4	A	well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	you know, it's amazing what he points out in that book
2776	4	A	and, in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the environmental protection agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to dr. price in nineteen eighty-seven. and in this letter he praised dr. price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that e p a had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis.
2776	4	A	and, e p a never published that report.
2776	20	B	and what's the name of this book again?
2776	4	A	coronary, cholesterol and chlorine.
2776	4	B	i'll have to remember that.
2776	6	A	yeah.
2776	4	B	that will be very interesting.
2776	4	B	my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
2776	4	B	so, he's really interested in the heart.
2776	6	A	yeah.
2776	4	B	and he's, in fact, he's a, well, heart, too,
2776	4	B	he's, uh, he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise .
2776	10	B	sorry,
2776	4	B	he made me laugh.
2776	5	B	um, so anyway,
2776	6	A	yeah.
2776	4	A	there is, there is a lot of good information out there, uh, about health.
2776	2	A	and a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true.
2776	6	B	yeah.
2776	4	A	i mean, i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's, that's good for you,
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	uh, but to believe some of the things,
2776	4	A	you know, and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet,
2776	2	A	but to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is just hard to believe.
2776	4	B	if you get a chance read dr. cooper's book on controlling cholesterol.
2776	6	A	huh-uh.
2776	2	B	that's a real good,
2776	4	B	um, he talks about that.
2776	4	B	talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that.
2776	6	A	yeah.
2776	4	A	i actually eat pretty much anything that i want.
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	4	A	and i've had my cholesterol checked and, uh, a few times
2776	4	A	and i've never been above, like, you know, one-hundred and fifty,
2776	6	B	huh-uh.
2776	7	A	never.
2776	5	A	and, uh, uh, i mean, i,
2776	2	B	you have a good ratio of good to bad.
2776	40	A	um,
2776	7	B	cholesterol.
2776	7	A	well, what they tell me,
2776	2	A	but, i mean, you know, everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing .
2776	2	A	you know, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued.
2776	6	B	yeah.
2776	5	A	but, uh, we've,
2776	4	A	i work at the t i site in hunt valley, maryland.
2776	6	B	oh, really.
2776	6	A	yeah
2776	4	A	and we've had a few of the health fairs up here
2776	4	A	and, um, you know, i've always come out aces.
2776	9	B	that's good.
2776	4	A	you know, i'm not really that big on watching what i eat,
2776	4	A	but i do eat, you know, some health cookies that are high in fiber,
2776	6	B	yeah.
2776	7	A	low in fat and all that kind of stuff.
2776	4	A	but, i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine, i'm not,  cholesterol, i'm not  worried about it.
2790	0	A	all right.
2790	20	B	what, what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation?
2790	2	A	i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force.
2790	6	B	yeah.
2790	2	A	few are, uh, basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively.
2790	3	B	uh-huh.
2790	3	B	yeah,
2790	4	B	i, i, i grew up in, uh, sixties and early seventies
2790	4	B	and, uh, my mom didn't work at all when i was growing up.
2790	4	B	she didn't start working until i was, um, well into high school.
2790	6	A	uh-huh.
2790	2	B	so, i, i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids, it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids.
2790	3	A	yeah,
2790	3	A	true.
2790	4	A	well, mine taught kindergarten
2790	4	A	but she was always, uh,
2790	4	A	i guess her schedule was shorter
2790	4	A	so she was always, uh,
2790	24	B	# always home by the time you got home. #
2790	7	A	# home,
2790	5	A	yeah.
2790	5	A	yeah,
2790	2	A	that, that statistic i guess # has been growing every year
2790	4	A	it's like something around sixty, sixty-five percent or so now.
2790	6	B	uh-huh.
2790	4	A	uh, i'm not sure what the future holds for that
2790	5	A	whether,
2790	2	B	it seems like there's, it seems that there's a grass roots, um, effort or whatever going on
2790	4	B	i, i, um, clean houses part-time,
2790	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2790	4	B	# and # almost all the people that i clean for, believe it or not, are mothers that don't work .
2790	6	A	huh.
2790	6	B	um,
2790	9	A	# that's unusual . #
2790	5	B	# they are, th-, # they're all, um,
2790	2	B	it's, and it's, i think it's kind of a new movement
2790	2	B	it's going back towards, you know,
2790	4	B	women have come into the work force in the last twenty, thirty years
2790	2	B	and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where, you know, women stayed home with the kids, you know, and try to give the kids quality time.
2790	6	A	uh-huh.
2790	2	B	and i, i think that in the future you're, i think you're going to see a lot more, um, women choosing to not work after they have a baby.
2790	6	A	yeah.
2790	2	B	um, i think with, uh, the, uh, the work force with the, the salaries that
2790	4	B	a lot of, a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are, um, vice-presidents of companies
2790	2	B	and i think with, uh, um, this, it seems like it's more the upper-class people,
2790	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2790	4	B	# um, # i don't see it as much, the, like in my situation where i don't, i don't have children yet,
2790	4	B	but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids.
2790	2	B	but realistically that's,  i'm, i'm realizing that's  probably not going to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income.
2790	3	A	yeah,
2790	2	A	that is tough.
2790	3	A	yeah,
2790	4	A	we're looking at that now,
2790	4	A	my wife's about six months along.
2790	6	B	uh-huh.
2790	2	B	i think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids.
2790	6	A	uh-huh.
2790	2	B	you know, it's going to kind of kind of go along with the b m w in the driveway and, or in the garage or whatever.
2790	9	A	true.
2790	2	B	um, and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever.
2790	3	A	yeah.
2790	4	A	i'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home.
2790	2	A	i would think it would be women that were working full-time.
2790	3	B	yeah,
2790	2	B	believe it or not though the, all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home.
2790	6	A	huh.
2790	2	B	um, they're real active in volunteer work.
2790	6	A	uh-huh.
2790	4	B	um, one of the women is real active with, uh, muscular dystrophy. and, uh, does a lot of, of work with them on a volunteer basis
2790	2	B	but it's still, it's almost like a job,
2790	4	B	she just doesn't get paid for it.
2790	2	A	huh. well, i guess that's good that they, they've got something to keep them active.
2790	3	B	yeah.
2790	13	B	when, when your wife has her baby, is she going to stay home
2790	15	B	or is she going to,
2790	19	A	# yeah,
2790	4	A	we're, #
2790	7	B	# go back # to work?
2790	7	A	we're  going to try and have her stay home, for as long as possible.
2790	1	A	what do you think?
2790	5	B	that, that, that,
2790	4	B	i would, i would like to be able to do that.
2790	6	A	yeah,
2790	2	A	we think it's, uh, that important
2790	4	A	and i, i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction.
2790	4	A	i'm a, a counselor and a therapist,
2790	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2790	4	A	# and # i work with adolescents,
2790	4	A	and i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure.
2790	6	B	yeah,
2790	2	B	i, i see a difference in the generation of, even the generation before me,
2790	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2790	7	B	# uh, # were, you know, mom was like, um, mrs cleaver, uh, you know, june cleaver or whatever,
2790	2	B	where the, the attitudes were a lot different.
2790	2	B	um, as far as, i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more,
2790	2	B	um, ther-, there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and,
2790	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2790	7	B	# um, # a lot of the, the things that are going on in today's society,
2790	2	B	i think morally, um, it seems like there was, peo-, people were a lot better back then as far as hig-, higher standards.
2790	9	A	true.
2790	2	A	well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure
2790	2	A	and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too.
2790	6	B	yeah.
2790	2	A	so, kids are raised around their friends and by the media.
2790	3	B	yeah,
2790	3	B	that's true.
2790	2	A	and that's, you know, that's contributed,
2790	2	B	and i think, i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future.
2790	3	A	yeah,
2790	2	A	maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time,
2790	2	A	so. if there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they could work, you know,
2790	2	A	there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in computers at home,
2790	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2790	7	A	# and # those types of things, that would at least in some ways, um, bridge the gap .
2790	3	B	yeah,
2790	2	B	i, i think that, um, in the future, um, the, the family unit as it, as it once was known, is, is going to be nonexistent .
2790	1	B	what,  how do you, what do you think?
2790	20	A	about?
2790	5	B	that as far as
2790	13	B	do-, do you think there's going to be still a family unit
2790	15	B	or, or do you think that, um, the trend is going more towards single parenting?
2790	5	A	the balance
2790	5	A	i don't,
2790	4	A	the, the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so
2790	4	A	and it got higher than that for a while.
2790	2	A	um, that's hard to say.
2790	2	A	families are such a strange configuration anymore.
2790	4	A	um, i, i see a lot of families where,
2790	5	A	you know, in the, in the back,
2790	4	A	i grew up about the same time you did,
2790	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2790	2	A	# and # back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible.
2790	6	B	uh-huh.
2790	2	A	uh, nowadays it's not the case,
2790	2	A	kids don't, kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk
2790	2	A	and one of the reasons, i guess, is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working.
2790	2	A	they get bombarded with junk
2790	2	A	and they don't have to do anything around the house.
2790	2	A	they never learned to be responsible when,
2790	6	B	# yeah. #
2790	2	A	# the # bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while
2790	2	A	and they come back,
2790	2	A	and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
2790	5	A	so,
2790	6	B	# yeah. #
2790	2	A	# you # know, you create a bigger, bigger family, generation after generation but not really on purpose.
2790	6	B	yeah.
2790	2	A	so. it's not, not a real functional situation anyway.
2790	4	A	so, you know, i don't know it's, i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families
2790	2	A	and the families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society.
2790	6	B	yeah,
2790	2	B	i, i think that eventually the, the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore.
2790	2	B	like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are, um, you know, two parent families.
2790	6	A	uh-huh.
2790	9	B	that's pretty sad.
2790	3	A	yeah,
2790	3	A	it is,
2790	2	A	i guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change of what's important to people, you know, probably keep going downhill.
2790	28	A	and i, i don't know
2790	2	A	we, we feel like that, that we can make it on one income
2790	2	A	it, it may be tough
2790	2	A	but we may have to give up on some, some things.
2790	2	B	i, i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that.
2790	6	A	yeah.
2790	2	B	and it will, it will make the, the strain worthwhile.
2790	3	A	yeah,
2790	3	A	i think so too.
2790	12	B	well, i, i need to go ahead and, and wrap it up.
2790	12	A	okay.
2790	12	B	um, it was really nice talking to you.
2790	12	A	well, i've enjoyed it, stephanie.
2790	12	B	and, uh, thanks a lot.
2790	12	A	uh-huh.
2790	12	B	okay,
2790	12	B	bye-bye.
2790	12	A	bye-bye.
2832	0	A	okay,
2832	10	A	sorry.
2832	9	B	wow,
2832	40	B	that's okay
2832	11	B	. so, tell me about your home.
2832	4	A	oh, it's, uh, it looks like a little shot gun house, almost.
2832	4	A	it's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other.
2832	6	B	uh-huh.
2832	4	A	it's, uh, an older home,
2832	4	A	it's not new,
2832	4	A	i like it though,
2832	4	A	it's big.
2832	6	B	oh really,
2832	20	B	what kind of square footage?
2832	28	A	oh, i wouldn't know,
2832	4	A	i measured it one time,
2832	5	B	# uh. #
2832	7	A	# because # i was, uh, we had saw some termites
2832	4	A	and we thought about getting it sprayed.
2832	4	A	i think it was like,
2832	4	A	i can't remember,
2832	10	A	i'm sorry
2832	16	A	<laughter>.
2832	40	B	that's okay,
2832	40	B	that's okay.
2832	4	A	it's big enough for us, though.
2832	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	A	# we # kind of need maybe one more room.
2832	4	A	we've got two children.
2832	6	B	uh-huh,
2832	6	B	okay.
2832	20	B	so where do you live at,
2832	34	B	i mean wha-, what part of town. in here in denison.
2832	6	A	okay,
2832	5	A	we-,
2832	4	A	see, that's north.
2832	15	B	or down here in denison,
2832	6	B	yeah.
2832	6	A	okay,
2832	4	A	i live, i live in plano,
2832	4	A	so it's north to me .
2832	6	B	okay,
2832	4	B	up here then .
2832	4	A	i say down,
2832	4	A	i'm really from kentucky.
2832	4	B	i was going to say you didn't have the typical,
2832	2	B	you have a southern accent,
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	B	# but # you don't have a texas accent.
2832	6	A	right.
2832	4	B	well i'm originally from, uh, ohio, cincinnati,
2832	6	A	# oh, okay. #
2832	4	B	# so i'm # famili-, uh, familiar with, uh,
2832	24	A	that area,
2832	24	A	that dialect.
2832	3	B	right,
2832	3	B	right
2832	4	B	. also i lived in georgia for about four years,
2832	5	B	so the, uh,
2832	4	B	there's a difference too, between east and west, in the south.
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	7	B	# and, # uh, the way in which people speak.
2832	4	B	anyway, my home is, um, i guess it's about twenty-five hundred square foot
2832	4	B	and i have, uh, four bedrooms at the present.
2832	4	B	we're busting out walls and things like that.
2832	4	A	that's what i want to do.
2832	20	A	how many kids do you have?
2832	4	B	we have two,
2832	4	B	we have two.
2832	13	A	do you have enough bedroom space, then?
2832	19	B	yeah,
2832	4	B	we'll have enough bedroom space,
2832	5	B	it's,
2832	4	B	we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small.
2832	6	A	uh-huh.
2832	4	B	and so, we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it. and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit.
2832	4	A	that's kind of like what we'd like to do.
2832	4	A	we just had a baby a couple months ago
2832	4	A	and we've got a den,
2832	4	A	it's more or less a spare room.
2832	6	B	uh-huh.
2832	4	A	we rarely go in there, except for to play chess.
2832	6	B	uh-huh.
2832	4	A	we want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter
2832	4	A	and, uh, we need the one extra room.
2832	4	A	like, like you said, our rooms are too s-, the bedrooms are too small,
2832	4	A	the living room and kitchen are huge,
2832	6	B	# right. #
2832	4	A	# but # the bedrooms are too small.
2832	4	A	where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way, you can't rearrange it at all.
2832	6	B	right,
2832	5	B	there's they, uh,
2832	4	B	i know what you're saying there,
2832	4	B	ours is the same
2832	4	B	and they tend to put windows in the strangest places.
2832	6	A	# yeah. #
2832	4	B	# you # know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for,
2832	6	A	yeah,
2832	4	A	we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom.
2832	6	B	uh-huh,
2832	4	B	yo-, you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything,
2832	5	B	so.
2832	4	A	no privacy.
2832	3	B	no,
2832	4	B	we don't have a lot of that,
2832	5	B	yeah.
2832	4	A	well, we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house.
2832	5	A	it,
2832	6	B	uh-huh.
2832	4	A	i'd hate to clean these windows,
2832	4	A	i really would.
2832	4	B	i figured i'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean.
2832	4	B	ours are the double pane
2832	4	B	and you can't really clean them on the inside, you know.
2832	4	A	ours are those too,
2832	6	A	yeah.
2832	4	A	you must live in an older home too then.
2832	3	B	right,
2832	4	B	i do,
2832	4	B	the house is about, um, i'd say almost thirty years old.
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	B	# so # it's not a new home,
2832	4	B	it's, it's seen some wear and tear.
2832	4	A	ours has too.
2832	7	B	you know.
2832	4	A	when we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it,
2832	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	A	# and # he did it hisself,
2832	4	A	so most of that, by now, is falling apart.
2832	6	B	# oh. #
2832	4	A	# you # know, well i mean, it's not just horrible,
2832	4	A	but like this tile's come loose off the wall,
2832	4	A	the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile
2832	4	A	and i don't like that at all.
2832	9	B	um, that is awful.
2832	4	A	with that, uh, the great big tiles, square tiles like, that you put on the floor,
2832	6	B	# uh-huh,
2832	13	B	he did it in that? #
2832	7	A	# the, the huge one.
2832	19	A	yeah,
2832	4	A	instead # of wallpaper.
2832	4	A	i wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles,
2832	4	A	for that you put,
2832	24	B	# the normal tiles,
2832	6	B	right. #
2832	3	A	# right
2832	4	A	that you put # around a bathtub,
2832	4	A	that would be prettier.
2832	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	A	# but # this looks like floor covering on the wall.
2832	4	A	it just doesn't look good.
2832	4	B	oh, and also they're very heavy
2832	4	B	and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier.
2832	6	A	right,
2832	4	A	there's one big one that has come off
2832	4	A	and short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on,
2832	5	A	so.
2832	6	B	um.
2832	4	A	and he rewired the house
2832	4	A	and it's shorting out here and there,
2832	5	A	and
2832	16	A	<laughter>.
2832	9	B	oh, wow,
2832	5	B	i,
2832	4	B	that's one of the things we've been fortunate with, is our, uh, wiring is okay.
2832	4	B	we don't have a, we don't have enough power,
2832	4	B	um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house.
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	B	# i # mean we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves
2832	4	B	but our plumbing is awful.
2832	4	B	there is n-, there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work,
2832	6	A	# um. #
2832	4	B	# and # there's no other real shut off valves inside the house,
2832	4	B	so if something breaks, we have to shut it off from the main, in the street,
2832	6	A	# yeah. #
2832	7	B	# you # know,
2832	4	B	and, oh, it's, it can be really bizarre.
2832	6	A	yeah.
2832	4	B	and we never know where it's going to flood.
2832	4	A	we've got power surges on the west side of our house.
2832	4	A	we've got our stereo hooked up.
2832	6	B	uh-huh.
2832	5	A	well that,
2832	4	A	the power makes it run.
2832	4	A	it's never ran,
2832	4	A	it's always ran just fine, the clock and stuff.
2832	6	B	uh-huh.
2832	4	A	but it runs about ten minutes fast, except for about a month, for about a month the, the clock ran normal.
2832	6	B	um.
2832	4	A	and then the power went off again,
2832	4	A	lightning or something knocked it out
2832	4	A	and we hooked it back up
2832	4	A	and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again.
2832	6	B	um.
2832	4	A	but on the east side of the house it runs fine.
2832	9	B	oh boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there.
2832	4	A	he put new wiring in,
2832	4	A	it's all new wiring up in the attic,
2832	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2832	7	A	# or # i guess crawl space,
2832	6	B	uh-huh.
2832	0	A	but, uh, oh, no,
2832	4	A	he didn't know what he was doing,
2832	4	A	he really should have hired people.
2832	9	B	well that's something,
2832	4	B	my husband's in construction
2832	4	B	and he won't even touch electrical stuff.
2832	5	B	he, i-,
2832	4	B	i mean, he'll do a little things
2832	4	B	but he won't do any major rewiring.
2832	16	A	# . #
2832	4	B	# he # says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it.
2832	6	A	right,
2832	2	A	he'll end up killing himself.
2832	32	B	pardon.
2832	2	A	end up killing theirselves.
2832	9	B	that's right.
2832	4	A	my husband, he'll change out a light switch,
2832	4	A	but that's about as far as he'll go.
2832	4	B	well that's the way mine is, you know,
2832	6	A	# yeah. #
2832	4	B	# i # mean, he, he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around
2832	4	B	and he was like, oh my god,
2832	4	B	he says, looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there.
2832	4	B	and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry,
2832	5	A	. uh, was a what,
2832	4	B	the roof was really sorry.
2832	4	B	i mean when we moved in,
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	7	B	# we # had no idea how bad it was.
2832	4	B	it was a wood shingle roof,
2832	5	B	and we,
2832	4	B	the first year we were living there, we had to replace the roof.
2832	4	A	well he put,
2832	5	A	which
2832	4	A	i heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles.
2832	4	A	is it three or five,
2832	2	A	your husband probably knows.
2832	3	B	he probably knows,
2832	4	B	i don't know what it is off hand.
2832	4	A	well, he's got seven layers of shingles up there,
2832	4	A	and he told us it was a completely new roof.
2832	4	A	like i said, he didn't know what he was doing.
2832	3	B	yeah,
2832	2	B	he must not of.
2832	4	B	we stripped ours, we stripped ours off.
2832	4	B	we didn't put it over, 'cause we put composition roof on.
2832	4	B	and we completely s-, completely stripped all the old wood shingles off, put decking up, put the paper down, and i mean just started from scratch.
2832	6	A	uh-huh.
2832	4	B	unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain.
2832	9	A	oh, no.
2832	4	B	and we, and we had, we had almost, i'd say about half of the roof off,
2832	4	B	and it did this.
2832	24	A	and, uh, uh, a house full of snow.
2832	4	B	and a house full of snow, and rain,
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	B	# and # it came down,
2832	4	B	it did this in the middle of the night.
2832	4	B	we have plastic, you know, just tied down on everything, you know, as best we could,
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	7	B	# real # thick edge stuff, i mean,
2832	4	B	and the wind came in from the north
2832	4	B	and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night
2832	4	B	and we were asleep
2832	4	B	and, and i woke up
2832	4	B	and i got up
2832	4	B	and it was about four o'clock in the morning
2832	4	B	and i heard all these, these drips, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip.
2832	9	A	oh, no.
2832	4	B	i had water coming in every light fixture.
2832	5	A	# that,
2832	6	A	yeah. #
2832	4	B	# i had # water coming in everything that was in the ceiling, everywhere.
2832	4	B	and i mean it filled up my light fixtures, because they're the old kind.
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	B	# and # i would go in,
2832	4	B	and i'd turn on a light in the room, you know
2832	4	B	and the light would come on
2832	4	B	and the whole thing would be full of water.
2832	4	B	and i mean the light would still come on.
2832	4	B	it didn't blow up or anything .
2832	4	A	my neighbor, or a friend of mine when i lived in louisiana, her,
2832	4	A	we all lived on base,
2832	4	A	my husband was in the army.
2832	6	B	uh-huh.
2832	4	A	she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from hers.
2832	4	A	the neighbor's la-, uh, washing machine had uh, over done something,
2832	28	A	i don't know
2832	4	A	but it was leaking, just pouring water in
2832	4	A	and it all went through to her roof
2832	4	A	and it was coming out of the lights, fixtures.
2832	6	B	oh.
2832	4	A	the fire alarm went off for some reason.
2832	4	A	it shorted it out, or something.
2832	9	B	oh, yeah,
2832	9	B	that will happen.
2832	4	A	so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house.
2832	9	B	oh, my lord.
2832	31	A	no,
2832	4	A	not six feet
2832	5	A	but,
2832	24	B	but it's quite a bit, quite a bit,
2832	2	B	you know that,
2832	3	A	yeah
2832	5	A	you might as well
2832	13	A	so. did you have carpets and stuff?
2832	27	B	oh, several of our rooms got ruined,
2832	4	B	we have, um,
2832	4	B	we h-, are on pier and beam,
2832	4	B	we don't have concrete slab underneath our house,
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	B	# so # it, it got into the carpeting, got into the floor.
2832	4	B	the carpeting was already awful anyway,
2832	4	B	but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink
2832	5	B	s-,
2832	4	A	your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too.
2832	6	B	oh really.
2832	19	A	yeah.
2832	6	B	yeah,
2832	4	B	they came in
2832	4	B	and they had it,
2832	4	B	one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it.
2832	4	B	we had to call the insurance company.
2832	4	B	i mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof
2832	4	B	but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the re-, roof was being repaired.
2832	6	A	uh-huh.
2832	7	B	you know, which really wasn't our fault.
2832	16	A	# . #
2832	4	B	# i mean # we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather.
2832	9	A	that's right.
2832	9	A	that's right.
2832	7	B	you know, and stuff
2832	5	B	and,
2832	2	A	well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end.
2832	9	B	oh yeah
2832	5	B	it,
2832	13	A	are you finished with it now?
2832	13	B	uh, the roof?
2832	19	A	uh-huh.
2832	19	B	oh yeah,
2832	19	B	yeah,
2832	4	B	it's, it's been done for quite some time.
2832	4	B	we're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof.
2832	6	A	uh-huh,
2832	20	A	how long have you lived there?
2832	4	B	uh, see, it's three,
2832	4	B	it's just been a-, at three years.
2832	4	B	we've been in the house just the three years.
2832	4	B	we've been doing a lot of remodeling.
2832	4	B	i mean, it's, it had detached, it had a dir-, detached garage
2832	4	B	and my husband's built a walkway across
2832	4	B	and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that
2832	5	B	so we,
2832	13	A	you all did it yourselves?
2832	13	B	what, uh, the walk?
2832	27	A	the home improvements.
2832	19	B	oh yeah,
2832	19	B	yeah,
2832	4	B	he see he does this for a living,
2832	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2832	4	B	# i # mean this is what,
2839	0	A	all right.
2839	6	B	yes,
2839	2	B	i think we're terribly taxed.
2839	2	B	i, i think the republicans have taxed us just as much as the democrats,
2839	2	B	and i don't think there's a change between one party than the other.
2839	2	B	uh, i think we get a lot back,
2839	2	B	but not as much as we should.
2839	2	A	uh, i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it, there's got to be something.
2839	2	A	when, when we pay so much for the, for the debt, instead of using the money for where
2839	6	B	# right. #
2839	7	A	# it ought # to go, it, it's just, it's ridiculous.
2839	5	A	what kills me is when they had a chance to, to, uh, put into ac-, action the, the g-, the glen-, rub-,
2839	20	A	what is it, uh, the act where they had to cut everything across the board
2839	4	B	the gramm, # the gramm rudman act.
2839	5	B	yeah. #
2839	2	A	# they kept doing, # they kept putting off doing that.
2839	8	A	why did they do that?
2839	2	A	that's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together.
2839	6	B	yeah,
2839	2	B	well i think they spend too much.
2839	2	B	they, they spend too much on themselves, too,
2839	2	B	the, the,
2839	3	A	oh, yeah,
2839	3	A	i think so too.
2839	7	B	a lot of the, the  taxes gets back to the members of the congress and everything all running for twenty years, # rather than. #
2839	3	A	# yeah,
2839	2	A	well. # things like mailings.
2839	2	A	they don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things.
2839	2	A	they just think once they get there that they can do just anything.
2839	31	A	no,
2839	4	A	they don't, they don't try  to,  uh
2839	3	B	no,
2839	3	B	you're right.
2839	7	A	to  conserve.
2839	2	A	and of course, here at home, we end up conserving and conserving
2839	4	A	and, i mean, when i don't have money, i don't buy something.
2839	3	B	yeah,
2839	3	B	no
2839	2	B	i think, uh, it is the congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money, uh,
2839	3	A	they sure don't seem to.
2839	2	B	the national debt is terrible.
2839	5	B	uh,
2839	2	A	there are a couple of things i think we need to really work for,
2839	4	A	and i don't know quite how to do it.
2839	2	A	but i think we need to have the one line, uh, uh, veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything.
2839	2	A	if it's a good idea
2839	6	B	# right. #
2839	7	A	# it can # be done again.
2839	6	B	# oh, yeah. #
2839	2	A	# you know, # and if it's not, so what.
2839	2	A	at least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months.
2839	4	B	i saw one on twenty twenty about a month ago i guess, whereas one, i think that he was a senator from pennsylvania or something like that.
2839	4	B	maybe it was, uh, connecticut,
2839	4	B	i'm not sure,
2839	4	B	one of the small states up there, where he had a bill through for another, uh, a drug agency that would be located there,
2839	4	B	and he was the only one that wanted it.
2839	4	B	was going to cost millions of dollars.
2839	4	B	the drug agency didn't want it,
2839	4	B	and he was going to build it in his home town
2839	4	B	and they were going to hire a lot of people,
2839	16	A	<Laughter>.
2839	2	B	and it was ridiculous, you know, the whole thing .
2839	3	A	# yeah,
2839	3	A	this is, that's right. #
2839	4	B	# and, and, you know, they asked # him about it.
2839	33	B	do you really need this?
2839	33	B	this is going to cost a lot of money.
2839	33	B	oh yes
2839	33	B	we need it.
2839	33	B	but do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this?
2839	6	A	yeah.
2839	2	B	and they do things that are, you know, just like # the, uh, #
2839	3	A	# yeah,
2839	2	A	that's # just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on.
2839	3	B	yeah
2839	3	B	# that. #
2839	2	A	# and # the trouble is, you don't, you have so little input about it.
2839	2	A	you don't know
2839	6	B	# right. #
2839	7	A	# enough # to know what, what to do about some of this stuff.
2839	6	B	right.
2839	5	A	# i, #
2839	2	B	# they're # supposed to do what we say,
2839	2	B	but they do what they, they # want to do with it. #
2839	3	A	# yeah,
2839	3	A	that's right.
2839	2	A	# the other thing about is i think, uh, limiting their time in office would be good.
2839	4	A	i, i just
2839	3	B	# absolutely,
2839	3	B	absolutely. #
2839	7	A	# can't believe there # aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got.
2839	2	B	we need to get that through.
2839	2	B	we, we have said that, i've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea-, two terms is enough for all of them.
2839	6	A	yeah.
2839	2	B	uh, whether you're mayor, all the way up, city council, the works, i think. certainly president, that, uh, two terms is plenty.
2839	3	A	yeah.
2839	3	A	i think # that's right. #
2839	2	B	# and then we get these # professionals out of there,
2839	2	B	and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves, you # know, rather than #
2839	3	A	# yeah,
2839	2	A	wouldn't that be # too bad .
2839	7	B	living off of us.
2839	3	A	well, that's right.
2839	5	A	i think,
2839	28	A	i don't know,
2839	2	A	i think, uh, people in general,
2839	2	A	the, the, the idea of what you need to, to exist is so outrageous that it's not
2839	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2839	7	A	# hardly.
2839	2	A	# you know, it starts at the courts,
2839	2	A	it starts everywhere
2839	6	B	right.
2839	7	A	until we can't, we've just lost control of, of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, you know.
2839	2	B	well, it's so much money
2839	2	B	and you can't even add it up, you know,
2839	3	A	# no,
2839	2	A	you  can't even,  #
2839	2	B	# that's why they # think,
2839	7	A	can't even  conceive of what they're talking about.
2839	3	B	yeah,
2839	2	B	when you talk about the trillions of dollars
2839	6	A	yeah.
2839	7	B	on this and that.
2839	4	B	our # national #
2839	6	A	# yeah. #
2839	7	B	debt in the trillions of dollars, you know.
2839	5	A	i mean it jus-,  and, and you just,
2839	2	A	the other thing is, it's, it's all very well to give money to help people, other people,
2839	2	A	and i think we need to do that.
2839	2	A	but there are, they need to put more limits on them.
2839	2	A	they need to # restrain #
2839	24	B	# foreign # aid,
2839	5	B	yeah.
2839	7	A	about what they do.
2839	2	B	foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely
2839	6	A	yeah .
2839	7	B	necessary.
2839	2	B	# they, they've given that away for fifty years. #
2839	2	A	# i, i, you know, i think that's probably, # un-, unless we can afford it,
2839	2	A	if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again.
2839	3	B	i agree,
2839	3	B	i agree.
2839	4	A	you know, i don't really mind helping people,
2839	2	A	but you, you need to get rid of this thing that's, that's just, uh, eating us up
2839	6	B	uh-huh.
2839	7	A	you know, and get things on a, on an even,
2839	2	A	if it were, if it were a family, we'd be up before the, the magistrate
2839	6	B	right.
2839	7	A	for, for doing all these wicked things, you know,
2839	2	A	but the government does it,
2839	2	A	and it's all right.
2839	3	B	yeah,
2839	2	B	i, i know we're taxed to death on every, every thing.
2839	4	B	i don't know what's the best way to do it,
2839	2	B	but, uh, they don't even talk about that.
2839	2	B	they just raise it.
2839	2	B	they don't even consider it, # like you saying #
2839	3	A	# yeah,
2839	3	A	that's true. #
2839	7	B	to cut something back, you know.
2839	5	A	well, sounds like.
2839	2	B	they are at least doing something now, with the, the military, you know,
2839	4	B	they're cutting some of that,
2839	2	B	but of course, now, you know t i,
2839	2	B	you know # that's hurting us but although, #
2839	3	A	# yeah,
2839	2	A	it's good to see them # doing some things there anyway.
2839	2	B	but t i has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else.
2839	2	B	and if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic, uh
2839	6	A	yeah.
2839	7	B	weapon systems.
2839	4	B	but, uh, that's the only good that i've seen congress do, you know, and everybody
2839	5	A	well.
2839	7	B	and all the congressmen and the president and everybody, # uh, #
2839	2	A	# i think # we have to accept the fact that whatever happens, we're going to have to bite the bullet.
2839	2	A	and we're all going to have to do it.
2839	2	A	i, it just isn't fair, though, that when this happens in some places, it needs to all come off everywhere.
2839	3	B	yeah,
2839	3	B	yeah.
2839	4	A	that's why i thought, well, you know, this is the time.
2839	2	A	they need to put that into act-, into action and show they mean business. that they've got to cut, they've got to cut costs.
2839	3	B	yeah.
2839	2	B	the only taxes i think that are well spent,
2839	5	B	well not the only, but, uh,
2839	4	B	i think the, now i, i don't understand the present school thing,
2839	4	B	but, uh, i have two daughters,
2839	4	B	one's in college already,
2839	4	B	and one's about to be in high school.
2839	2	B	but uh, i think that paying for school, schools is the, schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime.
2839	4	B	and so i don't mind paying for school
2839	3	A	# yeah,
2839	3	A	i think that's right. #
2839	7	B	# taxes even though my kids will be out of it, # you know.
2839	4	A	well, i don't, i don't really mind paying taxes for, for positive things that are helps, like roads and
2839	6	B	yeah.
2839	7	A	making sure that, uh, that water is safe, and some of these things.
2839	2	A	but, um, you know, it, you just feel like it's out of control.
2839	2	A	you feel # like #
2839	6	B	# yeah. #
2839	7	A	they do not # have control of it. #
2839	2	B	# the spending is out of control. #
2839	2	A	and that, and so then it just aggravates you, you know,
2839	2	A	you think, i could spend my money,
2839	33	A	i could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing.
2839	3	B	yeah,
2839	3	B	oh, i agree with you.
2839	5	A	so it's,
2839	2	B	i, i think that's a wide open subject
2839	6	A	yeah.
2839	7	B	what you said.
2839	2	B	people need to take a stand.
2839	2	B	i think the people will here shortly, uh.
2839	3	A	well, i think that's right.
2839	2	A	if they don't do, if they don't, if they don't pull it in and start doing something, i think they're really going to have to i think.
2839	2	B	i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out, too, that, what they did last election,
2839	2	B	and, uh, ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in, you know,
2839	2	B	so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes, you know.
2839	2	B	they're supposed to represent us.
2839	2	B	that's what they're called
2839	6	A	yeah.
2839	2	B	but they don't.
2839	6	A	yeah .
2839	2	B	may, may, may, maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there, guys and gals whatever they are.
2839	6	A	yeah,
2839	2	A	in some ways we're awful lucky i guess.
2839	4	A	there a lot of, lot of places where it's worse than it is here.
2839	2	A	but
2839	3	B	i know,
2839	5	B	but it.
2839	7	A	still, you don't want it to get that bad, # good heavens. #
2839	3	B	# no,
2839	3	B	that's right,
2839	3	B	# you don't want to,
2839	3	A	# no, #
2839	2	B	# you # want it to stay as # good as it possibly can be. #
2839	2	A	# we need to get, try to get hold # of it and, and have it be, things be honest
2839	4	A	and, i guess, in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes.
2839	4	A	but i would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent. that they're doing something that's positive  for --
2839	6	B	right.
2839	7	A	for  somebody.
2839	4	A	i don't really feel like, uh, i don't really feel like i use taxes very much .
2839	28	A	i don't know
2839	4	A	maybe
2839	3	B	# yeah,
2839	3	B	that's, you're right. #
2839	7	A	# i do more than i,
2839	4	A	# i guess i do.
2839	4	A	i use them in the, in roads and lot of things,
2839	5	A	but, uh.
2839	2	B	well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex, uh, in the last say twenty-five years or so, maybe longer, they've built all these dams.
2839	4	B	you know, the corps of engineers have, uh, soon as they finish a lake, they'll go at, get another one.
2839	4	B	and that we haven't had, we've had droughts here in long summers
2839	6	A	yeah.
2839	2	B	we've had good water supply,
2839	4	B	and that's due to the corps of engineers building, looking years ahead and building all these # reservoirs for us, you know. #
2839	3	A	# yeah,
2839	3	A	they've done some good # things.
2839	2	A	the state actually did some good, good work on that, in that a couple of years ago.
2839	6	B	yeah.
2839	4	A	uh, sam johnson came out and talked to us  about that --
2839	6	B	# yeah. #
2839	7	A	# about # what  they had done.
2839	2	A	and they, they really had done some good, some good work.
2839	3	B	yeah,
2839	2	B	i think anything for water supply like # that. #
2839	6	A	# yeah. #
2839	2	B	california should do more of that too.
2839	3	A	yeah,
2839	2	A	there are a lot of p-, places where they're in real trouble,
2839	2	A	and --
2839	6	B	right.
2839	7	A	and  i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too, if they don't take, if they don't take that early stand.
2839	3	B	right.
2839	4	B	they just finished joe poole lake over here,
2839	2	B	and they need to start another one.
2839	2	B	i think every time they finish one they ought to just have
2839	6	A	# yeah #
2839	7	B	# another # one in line.
2839	2	B	# the water's critical. #
2839	3	A	# that's probably right.
2839	2	A	# the growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait  until something --
2839	6	B	right.
2839	7	A	til they need them.
2839	12	A	well, it's good to talk to you.
2839	12	B	okay,
2839	5	B	yeah.
2839	12	B	how many calls have you made?
2839	12	A	oh, about nine.
2839	12	B	oh yeah,
2839	12	B	i'm up to twenty.
2839	12	B	are you a t i -er.
2839	12	A	no,
2839	12	A	i just, just a housewife.
2839	12	A	i just heard about it and # found it fun . #
2839	12	B	# oh, well, great,
2839	12	B	# great,
2839	5	B	okay.
2839	12	A	guess i like to talk, that's all .
2839	12	B	well, it's been some interesting subjects,
2839	12	B	yeah.
2839	12	A	right.
2839	12	B	thanks for calling.
2839	12	A	uh-huh.
2839	12	A	bye now .
2839	12	B	bye-bye.
2842	0	A	okay.
2842	13	A	do you have any children?
2842	19	B	uh, yes,
2842	4	B	i have a daughter.
2842	6	A	uh-huh.
2842	4	A	i don't any children ,
2842	2	A	so i'm going to have difficulty with this topic.
2842	14	B	oh, okay.
2842	1	A	but, uh, what kinds of things do you and your family do?
2842	4	B	um, well, we go out and fly kites
2842	4	B	and we go fishing.
2842	0	A	um. *slash error should be 'b'
2842	4	B	and we go to movies
2842	4	B	and we go out to the farm.
2842	7	A	uh-huh. / *slash error should be 'b'
2842	4	B	and, and, uh, she likes to pick flowers and look at birds.
2842	2	A	um. then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days.
2842	2	A	i don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that.
2842	9	A	that's great.
2842	4	B	well, i'm divorced,
2842	4	B	but that's what, when she's with me that's what we do.
2842	6	A	yeah.
2842	4	B	and we color a lot
2842	4	B	and i read her stories.
2842	6	A	uh-huh.
2842	9	A	that's great.
2842	6	B	yeah.
2842	2	A	i think a lot of families now, they probably don't spend enough time together.
2842	6	B	yeah.
2842	2	A	you know, whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together
2842	2	A	and, and i think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed.
2842	2	A	just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing
2842	2	A	and, uh, because that i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot.
2842	2	A	and the communication helps you build on your, uh, helps  just, just build your family.
2842	6	B	uh-huh
2842	4	B	. and even, even when i was, when i was, uh, living with her with did stuff then too,
2842	6	A	uh-huh.
2842	5	B	so, *slash error
2842	6	A	yeah.
2842	9	A	that's pretty, to me that's pretty rare.
2842	7	B	yeah,
2842	4	B	i know.
2842	4	A	i like that.
2842	4	A	whenever i do have children i, i'm going to try as hard as i can to s-, see that we spend a lot of time together, you know,
2842	4	A	maybe just even, if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their her own thing all the time.
2842	6	B	uh-huh.
2842	2	A	you know, that's good sometimes because you need to, you know, get away.
2842	2	A	but, um, i don't think you, you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of, of losing your fam-, the family unit.
2842	3	B	yeah,
2842	3	B	that's right.
2842	2	B	because then you never get to know them either.
2842	6	A	uh-huh.
2842	4	B	they're all grown up
2842	5	B	and their,
2842	6	A	yeah.
2842	6	A	yeah.
2842	5	A	and as i understand it,
2842	28	A	i don't know,
2842	4	A	i haven't experienced it,
2842	0	A	but, *slash error
2842	6	B	yeah.
2842	7	A	you know, kids these days are growing up so much faster. / *slash error, should be sv
2842	6	B	uh-huh.
2842	2	A	and once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve, you know, you've pretty much lost them .
2842	3	B	yeah,
2842	29	B	they're out doing stuff by that time.
2842	3	A	yeah.
2842	13	A	so, um, do you think that you, do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter?
2842	19	B	yeah,
2842	4	B	i really do because, because i don't see many others
2842	4	B	and when, whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays, we'll see other families.
2842	6	A	uh-huh.
2842	4	B	but, not usually on the weekends we don't see very many in comparison.
2842	1	A	what do you think is the key to, to just bringing the american family back together?
2842	1	A	what kinds of things do you think can?
2842	2	B	well, i think they can turn off the t v for one thing.
2842	3	A	yeah,
2842	3	A	that's true.
2842	7	B	and, and go out and do stuff, you know.
2842	6	A	um. *slash error
2842	4	B	because she always likes to do things whenever the t v -s off.
2842	4	B	you know, she'll forget about the t v completely.
2842	7	A	huh. i think that's the first thing a lot of people do
2842	4	A	and i know i'm guilty of it.
2842	4	A	like i came in from work today
2842	4	A	first thing i did was turn the tv on.
2842	6	B	uh-huh.
2842	7	A	because i taped the stories from earlier today.
2842	6	B	right.
2842	4	A	and i like to watch 'em
2842	2	A	but, i think that's that is a big problem. the television
2842	2	A	and it's, it's too static, you know,
2842	2	A	it's something that you can do
2842	2	A	but there's no thinking involved, no motion, you know,
2842	2	A	and i think, think that's another reason why people are, uh, so health conscious now is because america's becoming really a couch potato society.
2842	6	B	uh-huh.
2842	2	A	you know, people aren't doing anything just sitting around, you know, no thinking involved
2842	2	A	and now, i think i think people are trying to get out of that.
2842	5	A	at least
2842	5	A	and that, um, there's a lot of um,
2842	2	A	it's becoming really health conscious
2842	2	A	and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that.
2842	2	A	and that's probably good, you know,
2842	2	A	if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that, that also helps.
2842	2	A	that's also something, you know, family oriented that everyone can do.
2842	6	B	yeah.
2842	5	A	um.
2842	6	B	yeah.
2842	4	B	but when was, uh, when she was here last summer we played tennis
2842	4	B	but she hasn't brought her tennis racquet over lately.
2842	6	A	uh-huh.
2842	5	B	when,
2842	20	A	how, how old is she?
2842	4	B	she's five.
2842	5	A	um. well, she has,
2842	4	B	we, we just been hitting the ball on the ground.
2842	14	A	yeah,
2842	6	A	yeah.
2842	4	B	she can't hit it in the air yet,
2842	4	B	and then we kick the ball.
2842	4	B	we play like soccer.
2842	2	A	you've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years .
2842	19	B	uh-huh.
2842	9	A	that's good.
2842	9	A	that's good.
2842	6	B	yeah.
2842	0	A	um. okay.
2842	12	A	well it was very nice talking to you.
2842	12	B	nice talking to you.
2842	12	A	okay.
2842	12	B	# okay.
2842	12	B	bye-bye. #
2842	12	A	# bye-bye. #
2854	4	A	well, we're just starting a family through adoption
2854	4	A	so i don't really have a lot of, uh, concrete, uh, opinions.
2854	4	A	just what i know out of my peer group, uh, has gone through.
2854	2	A	and none of it has been good .
2854	18	B	oh, really?
2854	19	A	yeah.
2854	4	A	uh, the ones that can afford to have live-in nannies,
2854	6	B	# huh. #
2854	7	A	# they # seem to be having an okay time.
2854	6	B	uh-huh.
2854	2	A	uh, but a lot of the other ones that have, are professional, uh,
2854	2	A	i'd say fifty percent of, you know, my peers that i'm, in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're, you know, going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade.
2854	6	B	uh-huh.
2854	5	A	uh, but i,
2854	2	A	there must be some good service out there # if you #
2854	6	B	# right. #
2854	7	A	really look and pay for it.
2854	20	B	what, what age child are you thinking in terms of?
2854	13	A	in terms of what they're talking about.
2854	26	B	no.
2854	4	B	for, for yourselves .
2854	6	A	oh.
2854	4	A	infant. uh ...
2854	14	B	oh, okay.
2854	6	A	# infant. #
2854	2	B	# so you're # starting from the b-, from the baseline.
2854	3	A	yeah.
2854	4	A	after eleven years of marriage. yeah, we are.
2854	4	A	we're actually, it's happening now.
2854	4	A	so, we're just going through the process.
2854	6	B	i see .
2854	4	A	so an-, and actually the question is, uh, very appropriate.
2854	4	A	cause i'm not sure whether, uh, how strong the maternal instinct is going to be.
2854	4	A	they tell me it's going to be strong .
2854	13	A	# do you #
2854	6	B	# right. #
2854	7	A	have children?
2854	4	B	i have one son.
2854	13	A	and did you put him in daycare
2854	15	A	or is he older now or younger
2854	5	A	or?
2854	4	B	well, he's, he's now eighteen. and in, in, you know, has completed a couple of years of university.
2854	6	A	sure.
2854	4	A	so he's out of daycare # . #
2854	5	B	# i,
2854	6	B	right. #
2854	5	B	and, and so that,
2854	4	B	but i was working full-time, # uh #
2854	6	A	# you,
2854	6	A	uh-huh. #
2854	7	B	when he was born.
2854	4	B	but i was very lucky because i was a, a college professor.
2854	6	A	oh.
2854	4	B	and so i was able to, you know, #
2854	4	B	and i, it was #
2854	5	A	# flex . #
2854	7	B	walking distance from, # from #
2854	6	A	# yeah. #
2854	7	B	my apartment.
2854	4	B	so i went up there
2854	4	B	and i sort of left him with, with a neighbor.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	4	B	and i left him in a carry cot when he was very little .
2854	4	B	and i said, you know, he doesn't need anything except, you know, look at him if he cries.
2854	4	B	but, you know, don't pick him up and, # and #
2854	6	A	# yeah. #
2854	7	B	this sort of stuff.
2854	4	B	because i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half.
2854	9	A	oh, that's wonderful.
2854	4	B	and i was able to, you know, get, his schedule just, uh, cooperated.
2854	6	A	right.
2854	5	B	and ...
2854	9	A	that's wonderful.
2854	6	A	# yeah. #
2854	6	B	# yeah. #
2854	2	A	and, and i guess, uh, th-, because of your, um, your, uh, profession.
2854	4	A	i mean, i, uh, i'm in corporate communications.
2854	4	A	but i've done free-lance writing in the past,
2854	6	B	uh-huh.
2854	4	A	so what we're hoping is that, uh,
2854	4	A	i mean my husband thinks i can do it.
2854	4	A	i've just never worked out of a domestic base, you know.
2854	4	A	# i've always #
2854	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2854	7	A	been in a corporate, uh, environment.
2854	4	A	uh, but i'm hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or part-time
2854	4	A	or if they don't have that, uh,
2854	5	A	my boss,
2854	4	A	i'm very lucky though, again too, my boss is very akin to family building.
2854	2	A	so, i think that's som-, th-, something that couples need # in going #
2854	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2854	7	A	into this.
2854	6	B	right.
2854	28	A	uh, i don't know.
2854	4	A	i do think there's good daycare out there.
2854	20	A	what part of the country are you in?
2854	4	B	i'm in maryland.
2854	4	A	you're in # maryland. #
2854	4	B	# but, # but i was out of the country when, uh, my, my son was little.
2854	2	B	but, but the thing is, if you have this flextime and that, you might be able to do something similar to what i did.
2854	6	A	# right. #
2854	7	B	# which # is
2854	4	A	that's what i'm hoping.
2854	7	B	you know, be there short times
2854	4	B	and then later on when he was, you know --
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	5	B	i mean this,
2854	4	B	we're talking about, uh, i went back to work and, or taught some, some classes like a week after he was born.
2854	9	A	oh, my goodness.
2854	2	A	# you were #
2854	5	B	# and so # ...
2854	7	A	fortunate.
2854	6	A	yeah.
2854	6	B	yeah.
2854	4	B	and so that's when # i was #
2854	6	A	# yeah. #
2854	7	B	saying, you know, don't, don't pick him up and stuff.
2854	4	B	but then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	6	A	sure.
2854	4	B	and she, she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	4	B	and then, i also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	4	B	and, you know, in a sense she, she carried him around a lot, too much. uh, you know
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	7	B	for, for my taste.
2854	6	A	right.
2854	2	B	it was constantly, no, # i don't want him, #
2854	16	A	# . #
2854	7	B	to explore anything.
2854	33	B	he might, uh, he might hurt himself # . #
2854	13	A	# # so do you think that, i mean, do you think that that was in a way though, good ob-, good objectivity that, that doesn't really,
2854	4	A	that's not a correct english #
2854	13	A	but , you know #
2854	16	B	# . #
2854	7	A	in a sense, you see what i'm saying though.
2854	13	A	from a mother's standpoint, i mean in a way, i-, it was quote and unquote good ob-, objectivity.
2854	23	B	i think it worked out very, very well.
2854	4	B	because what he learned to do by the time he was
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	7	B	two or so, he would sit next to the desk where i was grading papers # or #
2854	6	A	# see. #
2854	7	B	writing lesson plans.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	4	B	and he had asked for a paper and, you know, sort of scribble
2854	4	B	and then he realized that # there #
2854	6	A	# yeah. #
2854	7	B	were quiet times
2854	4	B	and there were active times.
2854	6	A	right.
2854	4	A	and then he learned he, he also learned that, uh, there were times that you had to be gone, so you probably minimized,
2854	4	A	well we're actually, uh, we're getting ready.
2854	4	A	i mean, you're far enough away now i can tell you since this is locally, i make sure, we're going to romania in a few weeks.
2854	6	B	oh.
2854	5	A	and that's, uh, # just . #
2854	13	B	# did you # say romania
2854	4	A	r-,
2854	7	B	or armenia?
2854	7	A	romania.
2854	14	B	oh, okay.
2854	6	B	# yeah,
2854	6	B	yeah. #
2854	4	A	# as in, # like, what twenty twenty and, uh, but we, we're real excited because we've just developed a contact.
2854	9	B	oh, good.
2854	7	A	through professional people
2854	4	A	and it's private
2854	4	A	and it's hospital.
2854	4	A	it's, we're just very excited .
2854	21	A	# uh # ...
2854	9	B	# oh # great.
2854	7	A	and w-, i-, i-, what's the word i'm looking for.
2854	2	A	when you deal with issues like that, uh, in terms of family building through adoption, uh, and then you have people responding to you, well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare.
2854	40	B	oh # that's silly. #
2854	4	A	# uh, # issues are being raised prematurely in my mind.
2854	4	A	but i guess they're not because it's something i'll have to deal with sooner than later.
2854	4	A	uh, and i, what i've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion.
2854	4	A	i feel that if the child is healthy, uh, and as long as we make it feel secure, i'd love to do something like with what you did.
2854	6	B	uh-huh.
2854	4	A	uh, i don't think i could be dumper where i could take it from, you know, eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there.
2854	6	B	right.
2854	4	A	uh, maybe after two or three or, y-, years old.
2854	28	A	i don't know. um.
2854	5	B	oh, i , in my opinion, it's even than.
2854	2	B	i mean
2854	6	A	# yeah. #
2854	7	B	# your # kids need you .
2854	2	A	well, they need a schedule i think.
2854	2	A	i don't think the united states,
2854	20	A	what country were you, uh, in europe when you were uh, uh?
2854	31	B	no,
2854	4	B	i was in the middle east.
2854	5	A	uh, that's .
2854	2	A	well, that's the same thing.
2854	28	A	i mean i don't know how they are there
2854	4	A	but, uh, in eastern europe,
2854	4	A	my stepfather's from england,
2854	2	A	it just seems the united states does not provide for either child care or geriat-, or elder care, as i call it.
2854	6	B	right,
2854	6	B	right.
2854	2	A	uh, and we're just not set up for that.
2854	5	A	uh, # with the . #
2854	5	B	# i,
2854	6	B	yeah. #
2854	11	A	go ahead.
2854	31	B	no,
2854	4	B	i was just going to say, i guess, uh, my sensitivities are, are much more with the, you know, to be at home.
2854	4	B	because actually, i had
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	7	B	my grandmother with me from the time she was from the time she was ninety-two until she died at ninety-seven.
2854	9	A	see, i think that's wonderful.
2854	4	B	and, i mean, that was recently after my son, was going off.
2854	5	B	and i mean, yes,
2854	4	B	in a sense, i went to work
2854	4	B	and she was at home alone some of the time.
2854	2	B	but, but still, you know, it was much better than being shipped # to #
2854	5	A	# to. #
2854	7	B	a daycare center.
2854	6	A	right.
2854	7	B	you know, which is much my feelings on kids and the elderly.
2854	2	B	i think we're t-, we're too, too much # towards it's somebody #
2854	24	A	# we cast off. #
2854	7	B	problem, you # know. #
2854	6	A	# right, #
2854	6	A	# right.
2854	5	A	th-,
2854	4	A	i'm that way.
2854	5	A	yeah. #
2854	33	B	# i want to work.
2854	33	B	shove # them in, in some school for twelve hours a day.
2854	6	A	right.
2854	2	A	it's easier
2854	2	A	and i agree with that.
2854	5	A	that's why i
2854	6	B	yeah.
2854	7	A	y-, you know,
2854	2	A	what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown
2854	2	A	but you can probably empathize with this.
2854	4	A	it's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts .
2854	6	B	right,
2854	6	B	right.
2854	4	A	in terms of what to do. uh,
2854	2	A	and i just don't think there is a day, a good daycare system.
2854	4	A	uh, my company, i'm particularly fortunate that they have, they're in tune with that.
2854	4	A	but i've been at companies where, uh, you know, the, deci-,  the, the trend  is, or the definite mood is, well we made conscious decisions not to have children.
2854	9	B	and that's sad.
2854	5	A	you know.
2854	5	A	and in,
2854	4	A	and a couple like us building through adoption, there, it's almost radical to some people.
2854	7	B	right.
2854	4	A	and what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out
2854	4	A	and, uh, i respect, there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they, you know, they may have the need for child care like that.
2854	6	B	uh-huh.
2854	9	A	but i agree with you, that it's just, i call it dumping .
2854	6	B	yeah.
2854	5	A	i, # i # ...
2854	6	B	# no,
2854	2	B	# i, i think that certainly there is a role, uh, for this type of help.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	2	B	and, and as long as one can, can supervise it and, and, you know, make it work in, into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping   or
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	7	B	or,   or,  uh, giving it, you know, the whole job to somebody else to take care of.
2854	24	A	then, yeah,
2854	2	A	# it's ar-, #
2854	0	B	# . #
2854	7	A	in tandem then.
2854	6	B	yeah,
2854	6	B	# yeah
2854	16	B	. #
2854	5	A	# i just, # uh,
2854	4	A	and there are trade-offs too i think.
2854	2	A	one of the things that is a problem is that, uh, in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers.
2854	6	B	uh-huh.
2854	2	A	uh, it's just, you know, it's so low
2854	4	A	but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis, it's prohibitive.
2854	4	A	and some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year
2854	6	B	yeah.
2854	7	A	uh ...
2854	4	B	actually, there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood.
2854	5	B	# is # --
2854	6	A	# really. #
2854	2	B	there seem, there are several, u-, u-, m-, mothers who stay home.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	5	B	and they take, you know,
2854	2	B	it's probably not completely legal .
2854	5	B	uh, i,
2854	2	B	maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids.
2854	6	A	sure.
2854	4	B	but, and they, they take care of another child
2854	4	B	and i, i can actually n-, could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	5	A	# and they,
2854	6	A	yeah. #
2854	2	B	# and i mean that's # another possibility
2854	2	B	and, you know, you might want to stay home one year
2854	2	B	and some other lady might want to stay home for a, a few years
2854	5	B	and ...
2854	4	A	i haven't thought about that.
2854	6	A	yeah.
2854	4	A	and actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old
2854	4	A	and she's at home part-time paralegal.
2854	5	A	so i'm thinking, um
2854	16	A	# . #
2854	6	B	# yeah,
2854	6	B	yeah. #
2854	4	A	and we get along fantastically
2854	5	A	so i'm thinking, you know.
2854	2	A	and that's the way you have to, uh,
2854	5	A	how wa-,
2854	4	A	i'm just real curious.
2854	1	A	how was the middle east in terms of that with children?
2854	13	A	is that, is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them?
2854	26	B	no.
2854	4	B	well, actually there was a daycare center, uh, where my son did go for a year.
2854	4	B	i think from when he was two to three.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	4	B	but then he actually started kindergarten at age three.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	4	B	and so, and i-, you know, it wasn't like prekindergarten,
2854	4	B	it was real kindergarten.
2854	6	A	oh, really.
2854	2	A	he must be # smart.
2854	6	A	yeah. #
2854	3	B	# yeah.
2854	4	B	so he, # he was ready to, to go to school at that point.
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	19	B	but, yeah,
2854	4	B	they're, they do have such facilities.
2854	2	B	but for the most part, uh, th-, with the extended family, you know, you can usually find somebody. which is much like our neighbor
2854	6	A	uh-huh.
2854	7	B	you know, to, sharing responsibility.
2854	4	B	and i'm, and also there aren't that many women who, who d-, # who work. #
2854	4	A	# the professional. #
2854	6	A	yeah,
2854	4	A	i was wondering about # that. #
2854	6	B	# yeah. #
2854	5	A	uh, there,
2854	4	A	i'm in dallas
2854	4	A	and there was just a very big, uh, series about moslem women
2854	4	A	and
2854	6	B	uh-huh.
2854	7	A	there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts.
2854	4	A	i'm digressing here
2854	13	A	but, uh, i was just real curious when you said middle east, # if you #
2854	6	B	# yeah. #
2854	7	A	didn't mind me asking.
2854	26	B	no,
2854	26	B	no.
2854	4	B	and i didn't mean israel.
2854	13	B	so # you, you assumed right . #
2854	26	A	# oh, no
2854	40	A	that's okay .
2854	4	A	# well, even if you did, that's okay actually.
2854	5	A	# i think # ...
2854	39	B	# well, no #
2854	4	B	because at first thought, when i s-, you know, i said that not many people work, i'm, i'm thinking oh, well she's going to, you know, because certainly in israel the women do work # . #
2854	6	A	# right.
2854	6	A	right.
2854	4	A	they fight,
2854	4	A	they work. #
2874	13	B	so you like to fish, huh?
2874	19	A	yeah,
2874	4	A	i like to,
2874	4	A	i don't have a boat,
2874	4	A	but i like to fish
2874	4	A	and there's a lot of lakes around here.
2874	13	A	uh, are there many lakes up there?
2874	19	B	yeah,
2874	4	B	actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me.
2874	4	B	we actu-, uh, we have the, those little, the, the, the great lakes, you know,
2874	5	B	grea-,
2874	4	B	uh, lake ontario is right near here.
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	4	B	plus, we're in what's called the finger lake region of new york
2874	4	B	where there're lots of small lakes everywhere
2874	4	B	and these are, uh, real good, uh, for, like, you know, bass fishing and so forth.
2874	13	A	they have mostly small mouth in them
2874	5	A	or,
2874	26	B	no,
2874	4	B	we have a,  qui-, actually quite a  lot of variety.
2874	5	B	there's, uh, there's,
2874	4	B	we have large mouth, small mouth, uh, sort of musky, pike, stuff like that.
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	4	B	you know, all sorts of fun stuff like that.
2874	4	B	uh, we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on lake ontario every year.
2874	6	A	oh, yeah,
2874	9	A	that's right,
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	4	B	so it's, it's, that's, a lot of fun.
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	1	B	how about you?
2874	20	B	do you like, what do you like to go for?
2874	5	A	oh, it's, it's, uh,
2874	4	A	i fish for bass,
2874	4	A	but i hardly ever catch one,
2874	4	A	but, uh, uh, they have a tail race over in lake lavon
2874	6	B	yeah.
2874	4	A	and, uh, you know, they wash, when they open up the dam and let out water, they wash down the fish
2874	4	A	and, uh, you catch that white bass and crappie out of there.
2874	6	B	um.
2874	4	A	every once in a while there'll be striped bass.
2874	4	B	we have, uh, some friends who live on the lake
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	2	B	and, it, the lake it just seems, is, is completely filled with bass to the point where, you know, normally you go,  y-,  y-, go   fishing for bass, you get a lot of sunfish, or, or cat or whatever, and some other strange stuff. / *listen
2874	4	B	but in this particular lake, we went out with some friends, once
2874	4	B	and we just, every time you tossed the line in, you pull up a five, six, seven inch minimum bass
2874	4	B	and usually you pull up, you know, thirteen to fourteen inch bass.
2874	9	A	wow.
2874	3	B	yeah,
2874	4	B	it's a real, it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just, we pull up, you know, bass after bass
2874	0	B	and, *slash error
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	7	B	during perch season as well, you pull up a lot of, uh, - / *slash error
2874	4	B	probably during, during perch season the perch will run in very large schools,
2874	4	B	so what they'll do is j-,
2874	4	B	you'll, you'll be sort of boating around,
2874	4	B	these people own a little row boat,
2874	4	B	and they'll be boating around
2874	4	B	and they'll hit a, they'll hit a school of perches in the middle
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	4	B	and when they do, you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at,
2874	4	B	they, they just drop it in.
2874	4	B	they can't pull it in fast enough.
2874	20	A	what do you, what do you catch perch on?
2874	5	B	uh, i, they actually, they,
2874	4	B	according to them, you can catch, when the perch are running, you can catch them on just about anything.
2874	6	A	huh.
2874	4	B	they tend to use, i guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes,
2874	4	B	but, you know, i've,
2874	4	B	she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything, you know.
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	5	B	they'll,
2874	4	B	corn or salami or bread or anything,
2874	4	B	they'll, they'll, they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded, these large schools.
2874	6	A	yeah,
2874	5	A	it's,
2874	4	A	sometimes i use corn,
2874	4	A	but, uh, uh, some fish steal it off the hook sometimes.
2874	3	B	yeah,
2874	2	B	it's a big problem.
2874	3	A	yeah,
2874	4	A	uh, the other day i was fishing with bread, uh,
2874	4	A	there's a college across the street
2874	6	B	yeah.
2874	5	A	and they,
2874	4	A	it's, it's full of carp and, uh, i caught a carp on a, about, what size is that, uh, i think it was a number two treble hook,
2874	6	B	# um. #
2874	4	A	# and # it's huge,
2874	4	A	its, its mouth was full of hooks.
2874	9	B	wow.
2874	4	A	so he was in a bad way.
2874	5	A	but, uh, it's,
2874	4	A	he was fast.
2874	5	A	he,
2874	13	B	a big one?
2874	19	A	yeah.
2874	4	A	well, it's, uh, it was sixteen inches long.
2874	9	B	wow, that's, that's, that's a nice size carp.
2874	19	A	yeah,
2874	4	A	i think it was about a pound and a half, you know,
2874	2	A	but all they're good for is the fight.
2874	2	A	boy they d-, they really don't want to come out of the water
2874	4	A	they,
2874	16	B	<Laughter>.
2874	7	A	they  zip through the water, you know,
2874	4	A	you're, how your line goes, you know --
2874	6	B	uh-huh.
2874	4	A	and i thought, you know, that, uh, i wasn't going to be able to get it in, because, uh, the one i hooked just about ten minutes before, when i tried to raise it out of the water, it fell off,
2874	4	A	so it wasn't hooked very well.
2874	4	A	but, you know, i got it that far,
2874	5	A	i figured that, uh,
2874	29	B	# that, that, that counts. #
2874	3	A	# yeah,
2874	4	A	that's what i # said.
2874	4	A	that's what i told the guy.
2874	4	A	the guy was standing there
2874	4	A	and he laughed when it fell off
2874	4	A	and i said, that's a quick release, right there.
2874	13	B	do you, do you, do you actually like the taste of f-,
2874	13	B	do you, like, eat the fish that you catch
2874	13	B	or are you more of a sport fisherman?
2874	4	A	uh, catfish, yeah.
2874	4	A	but, uh, i haven't eaten anything else, you know.
2874	5	A	uh, there's some, uh,
2874	4	A	my dad has a farm
2874	5	A	and there's,
2874	4	A	he has two ponds up there
2874	4	A	and my uncle has a, a pond upstream
2874	4	A	and there's a lot of crappie in there now.
2874	4	A	but, uh, i think he's the only one that's, that's caught enough crappie or, a big enough crappie to eat.
2874	4	A	but the catfish, there's, you know, there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and, # that,
2874	19	A	yeah. #
2874	6	B	# right,
2874	5	B	so # you can just, oh,
2874	4	B	because i don't actually like fish.
2874	5	B	it's sort of,
2874	4	B	so when i fish, it's more for sport than anything else.
2874	6	A	yeah,
2874	5	A	and if, you know,
2874	2	A	when you, when you have to look in their eyes and, you know, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish
2874	3	B	right.
2874	7	A	you know, because you have to sever their spinal cord.
2874	2	B	and, and, and, and, and be careful you don't get stung.
2874	6	A	yeah,
2874	6	A	yeah.
2874	3	B	yeah,
2874	4	B	i know it.
2874	13	B	have you ever tried, uh, deep sea fishing?
2874	36	A	uh, not yet.
2874	4	A	my brother went off the coast of maine, uh,
2874	5	A	when the,
2874	28	A	i don't know,
2874	5	A	what they,
2874	5	A	mackerel --
2874	6	B	yeah.
2874	13	A	that school up there? - / *listen--is there overlap?
2874	5	A	it's
2874	4	A	he, he said that it was just like that.
2874	4	A	they were throwing like, uh, uh, hell benders or, uh, uh, some other kind of treble hook lure
2874	4	A	and, and, uh, each time they bring them in they'd have at least one,
2874	4	A	sometimes they've had two on, you know, one on every hook.
2874	6	B	yeah,
2874	4	B	we, i was out in florida with a friend a while ago
2874	4	B	and we would go and just, uh, drop two, you know,  a, a two  or three rig, two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat.
2874	4	B	we just dropped it down there
2874	4	B	and, the captain had, you know, some kind of sonar in the boat
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	4	B	so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish
2874	4	B	and you just drop it in and and it just,
2874	4	B	you, you get one or two at a shot, you know
2874	2	B	and,
2874	6	A	yeah.
2874	7	B	it's a good deal, too.
2874	4	B	it was, it was a, like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat.
2874	9	A	wow.
2874	4	B	you know, and, and, and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want.
2874	6	A	yeah,
2874	4	A	down here it's like two hundred dollars a day.
2874	5	B	well, this is,
2874	5	B	yeah,
2874	4	B	this, this, this was for a, you know, large,
2874	4	B	there were
2874	29	A	a group party.
2874	7	B	maybe thirty of us on the boat.
2874	4	B	we, we weren't all related, just, you know, thirty people off the shop in the boat there.
2874	6	A	yeah.
2874	4	B	if you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day.
2874	6	A	yeah.
2874	4	B	but this is great, because it was, i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something.
2874	6	A	uh-huh.
2874	5	B	you know,
2874	4	B	so you'd get to go out there for, five-, for, for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and, and fish all day.
2874	2	B	it's really nice .
2874	2	B	it's real enjoyable.
2874	6	A	yeah.
2874	4	A	well, i, i don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not.
2874	2	B	i think we're probably close, though.
2874	3	A	yeah.
2874	12	A	it's nice talking to you.
2874	12	B	nice talking to you, too.
2874	12	B	good luck with fishing this season.
2874	12	A	good luck.
2874	12	B	bye-bye.
2874	12	A	bye-bye.
2888	0	A	okay.
2888	0	B	okay.
2888	2	B	i guess we're set.
2888	6	A	um,
2888	4	B	current events.
2888	4	A	i get my current events basically from news, uh, just because i watch,
2888	24	B	# television news? #
2888	7	A	# pretty much # a lot of television, um,
2888	13	B	is it, uh, c n n or headline news or just local,
2888	6	A	# uh, #
2888	7	B	# news #
2888	5	B	or,
2888	4	A	i watch a little bit of everything.
2888	4	A	i like to tune into, to c n n because, uh, you know, you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on,
2888	6	B	# right. #
2888	7	A	# everything, #
2888	6	B	# right. #
2888	7	A	# in # about five or ten minutes.
2888	2	A	i think news today, um, it's kind of losing its importance.
2888	4	A	like on, in, on radio, if you hear any news at all, it's like two seconds.
2888	6	B	right.
2888	4	A	you know, really quickly,
2888	5	B	# well, #
2888	7	A	# on # regular stations.
2888	4	B	on commercial radio, i guess, i, i tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work,
2888	6	A	# yeah,
2888	9	A	that's good, too,
2888	6	A	uh-huh. #
2888	7	B	# or evening on the way # to school
2888	4	B	so,
2888	4	A	i like k r l d.
2888	7	B	so,   i don't,  uh,
2888	6	A	uh-huh.
2888	7	B	i don't  see much t v mostly when i'm in school,
2888	4	B	but i do here.
2888	6	A	yeah,
2888	20	A	where do you go to school?
2888	4	B	uh, university of texas at dallas.
2888	14	A	oh, okay.
2888	4	A	i went to u t at austin.
2888	6	B	right.
2888	4	A	but, uh, i'm a news reporter
2888	4	A	so i, i should get all i can , my news from the new-, from the t v.
2888	6	B	really.
2888	5	A	but, um,
2888	4	B	i do tend to throw on headline news when i'm doing things around the house and just let it play,
2888	6	A	# yeah, #
2888	7	B	# and # listen,
2888	5	B	but, uh,
2888	4	A	i usually don't intentionally. although i should, i don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news.
2888	6	B	right.
2888	4	A	or i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news.
2888	4	A	if it comes on, i just happen to hear it.
2888	4	A	now, i will intentionally buy a newspaper to wa-, to,  to look at the news.
2888	5	A	but # other, #
2888	6	B	# yeah,
2888	4	B	# all i ever get out of the paper is a sunday paper
2888	0	B	so,
2888	3	A	yeah,
2888	3	A	that's true.
2888	7	B	i read the comics.
2888	4	A	# that's about it. #
2888	4	B	# that's about it,
2888	5	B	# yeah.
2888	4	A	the sunday paper, it's so full of stuff,
2888	2	A	but you pick your favorite section,
2888	2	A	and the rest,
2888	6	B	# right. #
2888	7	A	# you # throw away.
2888	6	B	right.
2888	4	A	although you paid, what, almost two dollars now to get it
2888	5	A	but,
2888	4	B	i like to listen to, uh, national public radio on the way to work because it's, i don't know, it's variety,
2888	0	B	and now,
2888	6	A	# uh-huh. #
2888	7	B	# they're # throwing in a little news and a little bit of other stuff.
2888	4	B	it
2888	6	A	yeah.
2888	7	B	tends to get like headline news if you listen to it for an hour .
2888	13	A	is it, is it pretty good coverage on there?
2888	19	B	yeah,
2888	4	B	it usually is.
2888	4	B	they throw in a lot of, you know, a lot of interviews and commentaries.
2888	2	B	it's kind of like getting a newspaper.
2888	4	B	there's a lot of
2888	6	A	yeah,
2888	6	A	yeah.
2888	7	B	sections to it
2888	4	B	and
2888	6	A	um.
2888	7	B	they, they present different sides of things.
2888	4	A	because i find like on k r l d,
2888	4	A	i like to listen to that,
2888	4	A	but each story is like no more than two or three lines, you know.
2888	4	B	oh, well they spend a little more time, you know,
2888	4	B	they cover the headlines,
2888	6	A	# yeah. #
2888	4	B	# and # then they go into a lot of the issues and
2888	6	A	uh-huh.
2888	7	B	things where they, they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and,
2888	6	A	# yeah,
2888	4	A	that would probably be better. #
2888	7	B	# interviewing people.
2888	5	B	and it's, #
2888	2	A	especially when you look for the, like, popular radio stations like mostly the music stations, news is, is pretty much nonexistent.
2888	6	B	yeah.
2888	2	A	they have little, little, teeny-weeny news,
2888	16	B	<Laughter>.
2888	7	A	breaks, you know.
2888	6	B	yeah,
2888	4	B	and only in the morning, i guess, there's a little bit.
2888	6	A	yeah,
2888	6	A	yeah,
2888	4	A	basically.
2888	4	B	i haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long i wouldn't know.
2888	6	A	yeah.
2888	5	B	so,
2888	21	A	so let's see, um,
2888	4	B	and i guess i get some kinds of other, you know, business related news through trade journals and things
2888	5	B	but,
2888	6	A	uh-huh.
2888	6	B	uh,
2888	4	A	the only reason i get trade journals is like if i'm looking for a job or something .
2888	6	B	right .
2888	7	A	which is what i'm doing now.
2888	6	B	yeah,
2888	5	A	# but, um, #
2888	2	B	# a lot # of people are.
2888	6	A	yeah,
2888	2	A	trying to get out of wherever they are
2888	2	A	but, um, i think, i think news is,
2888	4	A	i'm wondering where it's going.
2888	5	A	you know how,
2888	2	A	i think it will be nonex-, pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper.
2888	4	A	i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news.
2888	2	A	and now, it's, it's kind of your final choice.
2888	2	A	you watch,
2888	2	A	first you go to c n n, then you go to radio or something like that.
2888	6	B	yeah,
2888	2	B	where nobody wants,
2888	5	A	# and i think it, #
2888	7	B	# to sit down and # read.
2888	6	A	yeah,
2888	6	A	yeah.
2888	4	B	it's, it takes a lot more time to read something,
2888	6	A	# yeah. #
2888	4	B	# and # you've got news,
2888	2	A	# so much more effort. #
2888	7	B	# bombarding you from everywhere # now.
2888	6	A	# yeah. #
2888	4	B	# you # know you,
2888	6	A	# yeah. #
2888	7	B	# turn # on the t v, turn on the radio.
2888	2	A	but i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again.
2888	20	B	why is that?
2888	5	A	i don't,
2888	2	A	well, just because i'm, i'm thinking that it, it's getting so short on radio.
2888	4	A	you still, you have two or three,
2888	4	A	i know in dallas you can probably get two, two all news radio stations out of i don't how many popular radio stations.
2888	4	A	and then on television, you have just the news at six and ten.
2888	6	B	yeah,
2888	5	B	i just,
2888	2	A	and i just, i just see that dwindling in, in,
2888	2	B	i find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television, i mean, just given the way society is.
2888	4	B	and i enjoy reading,
2888	2	B	but most
2888	3	A	true,
2888	3	A	yeah.
2888	7	B	people would rather turn on the tube and, and, and,
2888	3	A	# true.
2888	3	A	that's true, too,
2888	3	A	yeah. #
2888	7	B	# flip through the channels, you # know, and get the headline news at thirty minutes of,
2888	24	A	than sit down and take the effort to read
2888	3	B	right.
2888	7	A	the paper.
2888	2	B	and they don't have to go get one, you know.
2888	2	A	one thing i like about the paper, um, as opposed  to television is that, uh, when i, like when i report, because i'm in television, i have to get the basic, the main facts and that's it.
2888	2	A	that's all you have time for.
2888	6	B	right.
2888	6	B	right.
2888	2	A	whereas in the paper, i like to read the articles because they get every side, every single side,
2888	4	A	and, and every point they make, you know.
2888	6	B	right.
2888	7	A	and, and it's all there.
2888	4	B	well, that's why i like, uh, national public radio
2888	6	A	uh-huh.
2888	7	B	because they get on one of these little things,
2888	4	B	they give you headlines that are brief,
2888	5	B	just,
2888	4	B	they touch on what's going on.
2888	4	B	and then they'll get into something and really explore it.
2888	6	A	uh-huh,
2888	6	A	uh-huh.
2888	2	B	and it's, it's informative.
2888	2	B	it's a lot more informative than, you know, quick, half hour news shows that
2888	6	A	yeah.
2888	7	B	they tell you what they want you to hear.
2888	6	A	yeah,
2888	4	A	because that's what we do.
2888	4	A	i mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, you know.
2888	6	B	right.
2888	4	A	so it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time.
2888	2	A	so, and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by i think.
2888	28	A	i don't know.
2888	6	B	yeah,
2888	4	B	there's so much going on in the world.
2888	6	A	uh-huh.
2888	2	B	communication, you know, expands the world now.
2888	6	A	oh, yeah.
2888	2	B	there's too much going on.
2888	2	B	you can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there.
2888	2	A	i think that is one good thing, one great thing, about news,
2888	4	A	and we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, you know.
2888	6	B	yeah.
2888	4	A	whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it.
2888	8	B	and the question is, how much of it or how, some of it,
2888	2	B	i guess, there's a lot of debate about censorship  and --
2888	6	A	yeah,
2888	6	A	yeah.
2888	7	B	and  what we're really seeing.
2888	6	A	uh-huh.
2888	8	B	is it, is it the true story
2888	15	B	or is it a
2888	6	A	yeah.
2888	7	B	little bit biased.
2888	2	A	because even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they
2888	6	B	right.
2888	7	A	could tell us.
2888	8	A	so all we had to sit here and, and ask is well, what aren't they telling us, you know.
2888	4	A	so that, that was pretty scary.
2888	5	A	but we,
2888	4	A	i talked to one woman,
2888	4	A	and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in saudi arabia, she wouldn't want to know, you know, that they're bombing or, or this and that's going on.
2888	4	A	and at the same time, i talked to another woman,
2888	4	A	and she was so happy to know because she lived through vietnam.
2888	4	A	and she didn't know what was happening at that time.
2888	6	B	right.
2888	4	A	and she was so happy to get the information, you know.
2888	4	A	so there's just a lot of different opinions on that.
2888	5	A	but,
2888	4	B	i, i, you know, i like to, to know what's going on.
2888	2	B	sometimes i think there's just a little bit too much.
2888	6	A	yeah.
2888	2	B	you know you get in the habit of, like i say, turn on headline news
2888	4	B	and it will play over and over ,
2888	16	A	<Laughter>.
2888	2	B	and you just tune it out because it's the same thing
2888	5	B	but,
2888	2	A	and then, too, a lot of times i think, uh, especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion.
2888	3	B	yeah,
2888	2	B	they tend to,
2888	5	A	# like, #
2888	7	B	# dramatize # things.
2888	4	A	you know, like this kennedy thing.
2888	6	B	yeah.
2888	2	A	it's just, i mean, everywhere you turn.
2888	4	A	kennedy,
2888	4	A	kennedy,
2888	4	A	kennedy.
2888	4	A	you know, what kind of shoes did he wear on the night?
2888	4	A	and you know, it's just like, okay, this is # ridiculous. #
2888	8	B	# like who cares?
2888	6	B	# really.
2888	5	A	so,
2888	5	B	well,
2888	20	A	but what are you doing?
2888	13	A	sitting on a computer?
2888	19	B	yeah.
2888	4	A	i heard the little clicking.
2888	4	B	trying to do some c programming.
2888	14	A	oh, okay.
2888	12	A	well, it was nice talking to you.
2888	12	B	okay .
2888	12	A	okay.
2888	12	B	take # care. #
2888	12	A	# take # care.
2888	12	B	bye-bye.
2888	12	A	uh-huh,
2888	12	A	bye.
2889	0	B	okay,
2889	20	B	what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have?
2889	28	A	oh, not very many of those at, uh,
2889	4	A	sometimes i, i play the trumpet,
2889	4	A	and sometimes i work on trumpet mouthpieces.
2889	6	B	uh-huh.
2889	4	A	and then i have a five year old daughter
2889	4	A	and we cut out things, kind of, you know, and color and, uh, and, uh, use markers and things like that.
2889	6	B	uh-huh.
2889	1	A	um, how about you?
2889	5	B	in,
2889	4	B	well i used to be more into crafts, when i was younger, like high school stuff.
2889	4	B	i was in four h
2889	4	B	and i did a lot of latch hook
2889	6	A	uh-huh.
2889	7	B	made rugs and stuff.
2889	4	B	um, and, uh, i've learned how to crochet,
2889	28	B	but i don't really know,
2889	4	B	i mean, i don't do it that much.
2889	4	B	not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad.
2889	5	A	# um. #
2889	4	B	# i'd # rather be outside.
2889	6	A	yeah,
2889	3	A	exactly.
2889	4	B	um, i used to play trombone .
2889	6	A	uh-huh.
2889	4	B	i don't know if that was a,
2889	5	B	not really,
2889	4	B	i don't play it that much any more,
2889	5	B	but i, um,
2889	22	B	what else do i do.
2889	4	B	mainly do reading.
2889	4	B	i don't have a lot of crafty type things i do.
2889	6	A	uh-huh.
2889	20	B	but, uh,  what are some other things you enjoy?
2889	28	A	i don't know.
2889	4	A	my, my father is in the, in the antique business.
2889	6	B	uh-huh
2889	16	B	<Sniffing>.
2889	4	A	and he, uh, he goes around to garage sales
2889	4	A	and he buys all kinds of, um, china and figurines and statues and # stuff. #
2889	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2889	4	A	and, um, there's some stuff that's really for, uh, auto repair.
2889	4	A	it's called j b weld
2889	6	B	uh-huh.
2889	4	A	and i repaired a, a gasoline tank with it once.
2889	4	A	but he,
2889	16	B	<Sniffing>.
2889	7	A	mixes colors in it.
2889	4	A	it's an epoxy resin that you mix together.
2889	9	B	oh, cool.
2889	4	A	and he makes like,
2889	4	A	the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a, a statue that's real small,
2889	5	A	it's like about maybe
2889	4	A	the hand's about the size of a cricket.
2889	9	B	oh, wow.
2889	7	A	and, uh, has, uh, like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out,
2889	4	A	and he was repairing that,
2889	4	A	and, uh, it came out pretty good.
2889	4	A	it's kind of a, kind of a ivory color all over  and
2889	6	B	# uh-huh. #
2889	7	A	# and,  uh, # has some age spots in it,
2889	4	A	and it looked, you know, just like it, it had been there all the time.
2889	5	B	huh .
2889	4	A	and he fixed some, fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them, and, uh, molds that in.
2889	4	A	he had a blue, blue bowl a few weeks ago that he, he fixed that way.
2889	6	B	uh-huh.
2889	4	A	it worked out real well, too.
2889	4	A	#   and then,  #
2889	13	B	# do you # ever,
2889	7	A	and
2889	32	B	huh?
2889	7	A	and then   he,  uh,
2889	16	B	<Noise>.
2889	7	A	he  thatches, uh, you know, those, uh, thatched chairs.
2889	6	B	yeah.
2889	2	A	course that's like that, that, uh, hooking that you were talking about.
2889	6	B	yeah.
2889	2	A	that takes a lot of time.
2889	2	B	that's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff.
2889	6	A	yeah.
2889	4	A	and he used to paint, um, a long time ago,
2889	4	A	but i think he's stopped pretty much now.
2889	6	B	oh .
2889	4	A	but outside of, outside of art class in, in school, i, i stopped doing most of that, unless i, i mean, like he has a computer,
2889	4	A	and i use, um, the graphics
2889	6	B	yeah.
2889	7	A	um, software on that,  to, uh, to do figures and to look at things, you know, see how they work.
2889	6	B	right.
2889	9	B	that sounds interesting.
2889	6	A	uh-huh.
2889	13	B	um, does, does he ever, uh, refinish furniture or anything like that?
2889	19	A	oh, yeah,
2889	4	A	sometimes,
2889	4	A	but it's not one of my favorite things, especially from the vapors,
2889	4	A	and we had, uh, an entertainment center we did last year.
2889	4	A	uh, we bought it at an, unfinished, uh, furniture place
2889	6	B	uh-huh
2889	16	B	<sniffing>.
2889	7	A	and sanded it down and, uh, stained it and then lacquered over it .
2889	13	B	pretty time consuming, isn't it?
2889	19	A	oh, yeah.
2889	2	B	but, it's g-, it's nice to have it when you're done,
2889	2	B	# i mean, looks pretty. #
2889	6	A	# uh-huh,
2889	3	A	sure is. #
2889	4	B	so, i've done that once
2889	4	B	but it didn't come out that well.
2889	13	A	did you use a, did you use a zar stain?
2889	27	B	uh, i don't remember.
2889	5	B	it was,
2889	4	B	i had my parents buy everything,
2889	4	B	and i ended up,
2889	4	B	it was their table, their kitchen table.
2889	4	B	it came out really dark.
2889	5	A	um,  they had a, um,
2889	4	A	well i saw the commercial on t v,
2889	5	A	and they,
2889	4	A	and, uh, and the people at the unfinished store recommended it,
2889	5	A	that's called,
2889	4	A	it's z,
2889	16	B	<Sniffing>.
2889	7	A	a r .
2889	6	B	uh-huh.
2889	4	A	and, uh, it spreads real evenly
2889	4	A	and it doesn't dry too fast,
2889	5	A	so it's,
2889	4	A	if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out.
2889	6	B	yeah.
2889	4	A	and uh,  we,
2889	16	B	<Sniffing>.
2889	7	A	put,  we put  tung oil on it.
2889	4	A	kind of made it sticky for a while.
2889	4	A	but after it dried out, it was, you know, it was real hard,
2889	4	A	and it was all right.
2889	4	B	i remember it took me a long time,
2889	4	B	it took me like several months, or several weeks to do it during the summer,
2889	4	B	and then after i got it done it was pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking.
2889	4	B	since i've moved away they've had it redone.
2889	4	B	so, i kind of, kind of gave that hobby up real quick.
2889	6	A	yeah.
2889	21	B	but, i don't know.
2889	4	B	like i said, i like doing a lot of outdoor stuff,
2889	4	B	so but during four h, i mean they really encouraged to do all kinds of crafty stuff, which is in-, interesting,
2889	4	B	i like that .
2889	6	A	uh-huh
2889	13	A	. were you in a, were you the girl scouts, too
2889	5	A	or,
2889	26	B	no,
2889	28	B	well, yeah
2889	4	B	when i was real young i was for a couple,
2889	16	A	<Noise>.
2889	7	B	of years .
2889	10	B	excuse me.
2889	12	B	so, uh, anyway, it was nice talking to you dudley.
2889	12	A	well, it was nice talking to you.
2889	12	B	have a good day now.
2889	12	A	okay,
2889	12	A	you too.
2889	12	B	bye .
2889	12	A	bye-bye.
2944	16	B	.
2944	4	A	uh, well i mean i've had time to think about it because, uh, we've had,
2944	5	A	uh, i-,
2944	5	A	i-,
2944	4	A	there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to
2944	4	A	so.
2944	6	B	oh, okay.
2944	7	A	so,  um, i, i was thinking about a couple things, uh
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	7	A	and whether they are serious.
2944	2	A	some things are serious
2944	2	A	and some aren't.
2944	2	A	i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is, is, uh --
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	22	A	not the biggest thing,
2944	2	A	but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information, uh, situation,
2944	6	B	yeah.
2944	7	A	that you, uh, that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any s-, sort of credit,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	7	A	e-, extensive checks and, and things of that nature.
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	5	A	when, um,
2944	4	A	i, i, i mean i, i don't know if that's an invasion of privacy, simply, i, i do t-, i do feel it is
2944	4	A	but i don't know whether,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	7	A	some of the questions they ask are legitimate
2944	6	B	uh-huh,
2944	7	A	uh, because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your ,
2944	4	B	well what's scary is, uh, uh, about two, three, four months ago on a sun-, in the sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here, the dallas morning news.
2944	6	A	uh-huh.
2944	4	B	they showed a reporter and a, um, and a copy editor how they went out
2944	4	B	and they just took, um, a fellow in john q. public in dallas
2944	4	B	and all they had was,
2944	4	B	let's see, they had his birth-, they had something like his birth date, the street address,
2944	4	B	um, they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name, excuse me,
2944	4	B	and it was, um, very scary to see what they found out.
2944	4	B	i mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against, you know, two or three houses, through a two divorces, children's names, locations,
2944	4	B	um, it was really frightening.
2944	2	A	well i guess, i guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	7	A	that once you give your social security number there are people i guess who are, who are, uh, actually collecting all this all the time
2944	0	A	and,
2944	6	B	yeah.
2944	7	A	and  profiles are given.
2944	4	A	i understand, uh,
2944	4	A	i read the other day that, uh, these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	7	A	uh, all, all they need now is your telephone number, which i guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not.
2944	6	B	right,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	2	A	i, i, i feel that is an invasion of privacy
2944	5	A	but it,
2944	3	B	i do too,
2944	5	B	yeah.
2944	4	B	i don't, the other thing i don't like is, um, in terms of uh,
2944	4	B	like we just moved here from, uh, minneapolis
2944	4	B	and, uh, to get the, the very nice townhouse that we're in,
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	7	B	you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private landlo-,
2944	4	B	you know, husband and wife, owners, um, who had never done this before.
2944	4	B	they, um, asked us for again an astounding amount of information
2944	4	B	and what we really didn't have the same opportunity,
2944	2	B	you know, and i guess that's when i also get upset that if you're going to do it then i want to do it too.
2944	3	A	yeah,
2944	3	A	exactly.
2944	4	B	um, in terms of the credit,
2944	5	B	yeah,
2944	4	B	i know, um, we're also going through adoption now,
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	5	B	in for an adoption,
2944	4	B	and i mean after we gave our fingerprints n-, to the f b i,  you, you,
2944	9	A	my god.
2944	7	B	look at each other,  yeah, you look at each other  and say, well, , it's too late now.
2944	7	A	yeah.
2944	2	B	um, so i mean it's, it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try, um.
2944	6	A	yeah,
2944	4	A	i, i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me, uh
2944	6	B	uh-huh,
2944	11	B	go ahead.
2944	5	A	uh, well, by, b-,
2944	4	A	uh, i make my living by, uh, flying airplanes  for,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	7	A	for  a company.
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	4	A	and, uh, as a, as a, uh, an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing.
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	4	A	i mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time,
2944	4	A	so i when i finish a, a certain flight on a random basis i have to,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	7	A	uh, have a wri-, a drug test
2944	4	A	and, and, and that's without i-, uh, probably cause,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	5	A	and, uh, a-,
2944	0	A	and,
2944	5	B	it isn't,
2944	7	A	in the end now, i mean they've tested, they've spent forty million dollars
2944	4	A	and they've found, uh, i think, uh, in pilots anyway, of something like, uh, uh, eighty-six thousand tests there's only been two guys have come up, uh, # three guys have come up positive,
2944	4	A	and one of them was a bad test,
2944	5	A	so. #
2944	24	B	# positive for anything,
2944	5	B	see yeah.
2944	4	B	# see, uh, and i just started working, well for an electronics firm down here,
2944	4	B	i used to be a reporter.
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	4	B	and then now, i'm in corporate communications,
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	4	B	and, uh, part of that excuse me, was, as a new hire, that i had to take a drug test,
2944	30	A	drug test,
2944	6	A	righ-,
2944	4	B	and i had never been asked that
2944	4	B	and i thought, um, i really didn't like it.
2944	4	B	um, i, i have very mixed feelings about it.
2944	17	B	i don't disagree or agree with you.
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	2	B	um, i think i-, i think that it's well
2944	4	B	and you're in that field,
2944	28	B	so i don't know,
2944	5	B	but it's,
2944	4	B	you know, we lived in, uh, minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas,
2944	6	A	yeah,
2944	6	A	right.
2944	6	B	yeah,
2944	4	B	that hit the fan like, uh,
2944	2	B	you, uh, you're obviously aware of that, um .
2944	3	A	yes,
2944	3	A	i am.
2944	4	B	i don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of,
2944	2	B	if they're going to do random, um,
2944	2	B	i, i don't agree with random,
2944	2	B	i guess i would look for a standard in consistency.
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	7	B	you know, in terms of maybe at set intervals, so that everybody knows what's going on,
2944	2	B	um, i don't see a problem with that.
2944	2	B	i do think, i see some level of necessity, um, in something where people are transporting other people, uh, only because of the things you've heard about.
2944	5	B	the problem is
2944	2	B	the reason i feel that way, even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the, you know, majority, um.
2944	6	A	yeah,
2944	4	A	i, i can understand the public's alarm to it,
2944	6	B	yeah,
2944	4	B	i'm not alarmed.
2944	4	A	but, i guess, having done this all my life, i knew that there wasn't a problem
2944	4	A	and, and it, indeed it has proved out that way,
2944	37	A	but now, try to get the damn thing repealed, you know.
2944	31	B	you can't,
2944	5	B	yeah,
2944	5	B	i know, it's, um.
2944	4	A	i guess i feel bad because,
2944	5	A	uh, not only that
2944	8	A	but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints, i mean wha-, what, what happens if you say no.
2944	2	A	if you say no then you're excluded
2944	5	A	and i,
2944	2	A	doesn't seem the courts,
2944	3	B	right,
2944	3	B	right,
2944	5	B	it's a matter,
2944	3	B	and that's, um, exactly what it is.
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	2	B	i mean, that, that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion.
2944	2	B	um, if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to romania.
2944	3	A	that's right.
2944	5	B	i mean, if,
2944	2	B	you hate to say that,
2944	2	B	but that's the way it is.
2944	4	A	it's my feeling also that, that, that although
2944	4	A	i, i don't know if it's that serious, i-,
2944	4	A	but that was part of the question,
2944	6	B	uh-huh,
2944	2	A	i do feel the courts have, have held up a great deal of, of our privacy, i mean particularly look in, in some of the, in some of the,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	4	A	uh, i notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	7	A	which i support of course,
2944	2	A	but it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that, it does seem that we've, we've slipped and that's eroded,
2944	2	A	or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that, you know, it's fair game,
2944	5	A	t-,
2944	2	A	you, you have to answer these questions, of course.
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	28	A	uh, i don't know,
2944	2	A	i, i feel there has been an erosion
2944	4	A	and i don't really know how serious it is, except i don't like it .
2944	4	B	in terms of the privacy, yeah,
2944	5	B	that in it,
2944	2	B	and also, i agree with that
2944	4	B	and in the, in terms of the question, um, in terms, uh,
2944	4	B	i worked in medical public relations for almost a decade,
2944	6	A	um.
2944	4	B	and that was pre-aids and all the other, um, things,
2944	6	A	um.
2944	7	B	that were probably there but just not , excuse me, labeled
2944	4	B	and i have a real problem with medical professionals,
2944	4	B	um, it goes back to the things like drug screening
2944	4	B	but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment,
2944	6	A	uh-huh.
2944	2	B	um, and i think this is much stronger than, you know, pilots or, uh, train engineers being screened,
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	4	B	um, the transmission of the aids virus, um,
2944	5	B	i-,
2944	5	B	i-,
2944	2	B	that's a real ethical problem.
2944	4	B	i mean i don't, i don't have the answer,
2944	4	B	i, i, you know, i mean i think of the young girl in florida who,
2944	5	B	well, yeah
2944	5	B	that's,
2944	13	B	was she from your part of the country?
2944	13	B	# or was she from, #
2944	32	A	# what was that? #
2944	4	B	the young girl that, uh, contracted aids through her dentist, allegedly.
2944	14	A	oh, yeah,
2944	14	A	yeah,
2944	14	A	yeah.
2944	4	B	and then they proved it,
2944	5	B	yeah.
2944	6	A	right.
2944	4	B	i don't, i don't know, um, i-, y-, i don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general, or what, um,
2944	5	A	well i mean it, it,
2944	4	A	just take that, that step now,  where, where now  we feel there's a need to do that
2944	2	A	and the next thing you know then,
2944	6	B	uh-huh.
2944	7	A	uh, there's always the need to, to go and inspect lockers of high school students,
2944	5	A	tha-,
2944	6	B	oh, yeah,
2944	5	B	the,
2944	4	B	i guess the question is, uh,
2944	8	B	the, the thing for me is, who sets the parameters or who has the control, you know.
2944	6	A	yeah,
2944	28	A	i guess so,
2944	9	A	i mean well, uh, good luck to you,
2944	4	A	you just moved to texas
2944	6	B	yeah
2944	16	B	<laughter>.
2944	7	A	from minneapolis.
2944	2	A	uh,  i don't,
2944	6	B	yeah.
2944	7	A	i don't  hold out much hope for you.
2944	2	A	i think they'll be a cultural shock.
2944	4	A	i mean i was based there a lot, uh, several times in the service
2944	4	A	and i was absolutely flabbergasted at the,
2944	4	A	in, in at least in criminal law some of the, some of the,
2944	5	B	oh it's, it's ter-,
2944	7	A	latitudes that the police had,
2944	5	A	but.
2944	5	B	i'm, uh,
2944	9	B	very seriously,
2944	5	B	no-,
2944	4	B	more than just seriously,
2944	4	B	i'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the fall.
2944	14	A	oh yeah.
2944	19	B	and, yeah,
2944	4	B	if i figure out that's still what i really want to do
2944	4	B	and, th-, the things i'm finding out are the in terms of things like privacy, the way the law is interpreted, presented,
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	2	B	um, it's no better than journalism .
2944	16	A	<Laughter>.
2944	7	B	um, except in journalism it's words,
2944	4	B	um, this is very frightening in that, uh, oh,
2944	4	B	and in, uh, in texas they, they d-, they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents,
2944	6	A	um.
2944	7	B	whether it's domestic or international,
2944	4	B	they're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check.
2944	4	B	yet, if you're caught with,
2944	2	B	let's just say, um, that somebody who's in ne-,
2944	5	B	not us,
2944	4	B	but somebody who's need of carting, um, aluminum beer cans around,
2944	4	B	they haven't touched them,
2944	4	B	they haven't drank them,
2944	6	A	um.
2944	4	B	they picked them up off the street
2944	4	B	and they want to take them to a recycling, uh, resource
2944	7	A	yeah.
2944	7	B	for money, or whatever.
2944	4	B	um, they've, they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again, um, because they've been arresting people like that.
2944	4	A	well, i mean, i don't understand,
2944	13	B	you know.
2944	5	A	if you, if you don't,
2944	8	A	if they don't make a criminal check, why do you have to be fingerprinted.
2944	4	B	because, um, in our case, one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level. # because you have to de-, because you have to deal with the i n,
2944	5	B	yeah,
2944	2	B	because you have to deal with the, uh, imi-, immigration service. #
2944	14	A	# oh, i see,
2944	29	A	oh the state doesn't require it.
2944	13	A	well that's kind of, that's rather, that's rather unusual, isn't it. #
2944	19	B	yeah
2944	4	B	it is,
2944	5	B	it's, uh,
2944	4	B	the whole thing is,
2944	2	B	i mean there's, again there's no consistency.
2944	5	B	you know, like in your,
2944	2	B	in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly, um, i can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval,
2944	13	B	or you know, i mean
2944	16	B	,
2944	8	A	well i guess, i guess the extension of that is, why, why not,
2944	2	A	the next thing you know, we'll just stop a random amount of motorists
2944	2	A	and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street.
2944	4	B	they, they do that in texas.
2944	18	A	oh, they do?
2944	23	B	they don't do it for drugs,
2944	4	B	what they do is they check to see if you've got, uh, current insurance
2944	4	B	or they check  to,
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	7	B	to  see if you're permits are,
2944	2	A	well there's, there's all sorts of scare tactics, i guess, to, to invade our privacy
2944	5	A	and,
2944	6	B	yeah,
2944	9	B	i know
2944	4	B	and it's kind of, um,
2944	22	B	what's the word i want,
2944	5	B	i don't,
2944	5	B	it's ju-,
2944	4	B	to me it's just frightening, you know.
2944	6	A	yeah.
2944	5	B	i mean the old, uh,
2944	4	B	i'm old enough now where george orwell,
2944	4	B	uh, way past time .
2944	4	A	i just going to say, nineteen eighty-four,
2944	6	B	yeah.
2944	7	A	is come an-, is come and gone
2944	2	A	but it's here.
2944	3	B	yeah,
2944	3	B	it's exactly true,
2944	5	B	i mean i,
2944	2	A	and the computers, of course helps that.
2944	4	A	# the computer abilities store that information. #
2944	11	B	# well look at what we're talking now,
2944	5	B	# i mean, it's,
2944	11	B	look how we're talking now,
2944	8	B	i mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger, you know,
2959	13	B	are you a vietnam veteran, dudley? .
2959	26	A	uh, no.
2959	18	B	no?
2959	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
2959	13	B	do you have family who were in the vietnam war?
2959	26	A	uh, no.
2959	4	A	my father was, uh, came in right after world war two.
2959	14	B	okay.
2959	13	B	so he was too old,
2959	13	B	and you were too young, right?
2959	23	A	i am too young, yeah.
2959	14	B	all right.
2959	13	B	do you know some folks who have been there?
2959	19	A	uh, yes.
2959	14	B	okay.
2959	4	A	a couple.
2959	6	B	okay.
2959	1	B	how did it influence them?
2959	4	A	uh, the, the one guy i worked with down in austin hated it.
2959	4	A	uh, he was a lineman down there.
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	4	A	and while he was there, he caught some kind of a strange disease.
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	4	A	and, uh, all his hair fell out,
2959	4	A	and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while
2959	5	A	and,
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	and,  uh,
2959	20	B	uh, what about long lasting effects on him?
2959	13	B	has he still suffering from those problems?
2959	2	A	i do not think he was in combat,
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	5	A	so,
2959	4	B	well, i have talked with a number of vietnam veterans,
2959	4	B	and i really, i had no one directly related to me involved.
2959	7	A	uh-huh.
2959	4	B	but, uh, my sister's husband was in vietnam.
2959	4	B	and it, it really made a completely different man out of him.
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	4	B	he went to vietnam one man and came back another, not better.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	4	B	then, uh, another friend of mine went,
2959	4	B	and he was in combat.
2959	4	B	but he came back,
2959	4	B	and he said, "okay, that is it. that is behind me. i am going on with my life."
2959	4	B	much like what roger staubach did.
2959	6	A	right.
2959	13	B	he was, uh, he was a vietnam war veteran.
2959	19	A	yeah.
2959	5	B	and, uh,
2959	4	A	but he was in the navy, though,
2959	6	B	yeah.
2959	7	A	he was .
2959	9	B	that is true.
2959	4	A	it makes a lot of difference.
2959	6	B	right.
2959	4	B	and, but, uh, most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land, or in combat, are still, still carry a lot of anger.
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	4	B	they really do.
2959	2	B	and, uh, i, i, i, i really do not think that we did those young men right.
2959	6	A	huh.
2959	2	B	i think that, uh, desert storm,
2959	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
2959	7	B	shows a lot of learning since that time.
2959	6	A	oh, yeah.
2959	5	B	uh .
2959	2	A	well, the armed forces did so much to, you know, agent orange,
2959	2	A	they did so much to their own people all during that time.
2959	6	B	yeah.
2959	9	B	that is true.
2959	2	A	you know, and  they ta-, they take a,
2959	6	B	yeah.
2959	7	A	even now, uh, they take a  free hand as far as medicine and, uh, you know, how they treat the war casualties, you know.
2959	2	A	if you come back and your leg is blown off,
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	you know, or, or it is hanging by a thread, they still can't put it back together now.
2959	2	A	but,
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	but  what they do afterwards and how they re-, rehabilitate you.
2959	2	B	well, you know, one of the most troublesome things that i have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast asians into this country
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	7	B	since that conflict.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	2	B	uh, not so,
2959	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
2959	7	B	much that i say,
2959	16	A	<Sniffing>.
2959	7	B	i do not want you here.
2959	2	B	but there is just such a surge of southeast asians.
2959	2	B	it has affected the culture of this country, uh,
2959	9	A	oh, yeah.
2959	4	A	it's ab-,
2959	7	B	very much.
2959	7	A	it's about  nine or ten percent now.
2959	6	B	yeah.
2959	6	B	yeah.
2959	6	B	yeah.
2959	2	B	well, uh, the culture is changing.
2959	2	B	look how much more oriental food we have, restaurants now,
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	7	B	for example.
2959	2	B	uh, even ten years ago, there were not that many.
2959	2	B	a lot of shops are, are operated by southeast asians.
2959	9	A	that's true .
2959	2	B	a lot of people have complained in the schools.
2959	2	B	there is a culture change there.
2959	2	B	the southeast asians seem to be very hungry,
2959	2	B	there seem to be very studious.
2959	2	B	and, uh, tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them, which is not bad.
2959	6	A	no.
2959	2	B	not really.
2959	2	B	uh, but it might in the long run you can see where scholarships, for example,
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	7	B	uh, even jobs. uh, jobs that would normally go to an american, with a lesser education, might be going to, to some of these people here.
2959	2	B	and that is all a result of, of, of vietnam.
2959	2	B	and, and you see  a lot of,
2959	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
2959	7	B	a lot of  men that were over there, brought families back.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	5	A	that is,
2959	4	B	uh, and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there.
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	4	B	and i would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now.
2959	2	A	well, they are probably not doing very well at all.
2959	5	B	i know that there,
2959	2	A	because i know there is, there is still people even in the dallas area.
2959	2	A	there are, there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from, uh, vietnam.
2959	13	B	you are talking about p o w -s
2959	5	A	uh,
2959	7	B	or
2959	5	A	uh,
2959	7	B	missing in actions?
2959	4	A	na-, native vietnamese people.
2959	29	B	native vietnamese people.
2959	3	A	yeah.
2959	6	B	okay.
2959	4	A	they were lost, you know, when they were little,
2959	4	A	and, and they c-, never did get back
2959	5	A	or,
2959	5	B	oh, i had not.
2959	4	B	that, that had not occurred to me.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	2	B	that would be
2959	2	A	and,  uh,
2959	7	B	an interesting concept.
2959	7	A	and,  as is really a big waste because they didn't, they didn't win,
2959	4	A	they didn't regain any of the land that they had.
2959	4	A	it spilled over into, uh, now i can't even think of the country.
2959	5	A	but,
2959	13	B	cambodia?
2959	19	A	yeah.
2959	4	A	cambodia.
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	and to laos,
2959	2	A	and,
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	and  all they did is run and hide.
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	2	A	and they were not really fighting, you know,
2959	2	A	it, it would have been the same as desert storm if all they had been fighting was north vietnam.
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	2	A	but, and i am not even sure who was involved more. whether it was china or russia.
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	2	A	you know, they were pouring, they were pouring weapons in there and, and advising, well, digging tunnels for them.
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	you know,
2959	2	A	and there is no way that they could ever catch them.
2959	2	B	well, i think the terrain had a lot to do with the, the success of desert storm as opposed to that in vietnam.
2959	6	A	yeah,
2959	6	A	that is right.
2959	4	B	you know, there is incredible cover
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	7	B	in vietnam.
2959	4	B	and you can't find much cover on, in a sand
2959	6	A	yeah,
2959	7	B	dune .
2959	6	A	yeah,
2959	4	A	all they can do is dig in,
2959	5	A	and they,
2959	9	B	that is right.
2959	7	A	you know,
2959	4	A	and then they try to camouflage the top.
2959	6	B	uh-huh,
2959	30	B	uh-huh.
2959	2	A	well now, even, i think even now, and in vietnam they could probably have done a better job.
2959	2	A	because they could, they could kill all those plants, you know, which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on.
2959	2	A	but, and the, and the corps of engineers i think do a better job now, like they did in desert storm.
2959	5	A	because
2959	5	B	well,
2959	7	A	they had,
2959	4	A	he, he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	4	A	and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went.
2959	4	A	and they had to, you know, they had to blow them up  or,
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	or  disarm them.
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	4	A	and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he, where he had made those moats.
2959	20	B	what world war do you think they found the experience for that?
2959	5	A	uh,
2959	13	B	don't you think they learned from the mistakes in vietnam?
2959	5	A	w-,
2959	19	A	yeah,
2959	4	A	partially.
2959	2	B	part of it is that,
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	7	B	part of it is technology.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	29	A	part of it is technology, yeah.
2959	2	B	but
2959	5	A	because
2959	7	B	when, when,
2959	7	A	all,
2959	11	A	go ahead.
2959	7	B	when  you get into trouble like that in a place like vietnam, you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into,
2959	2	B	and you say, "never more."
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	2	B	and, and you overcome those problems,
2959	2	B	and you are prepared next time.
2959	2	A	i think that is one of the reasons that they have, they have pretty much avoided getting involved in south america.
2959	2	A	because
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	look what happened when they were looking for noriega,
2959	2	A	and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him,
2959	6	B	right.
2959	7	A	you know.
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	2	A	he probably just went right down into a tunnel.
2959	6	B	sure.
2959	6	B	sure.
2959	6	B	sure.
2959	2	B	well, i know that, uh, from a personal standpoint, people was one of the finest assets that we lost.
2959	2	B	we did not actually physically lose them.
2959	2	B	they did not lose their lives,
2959	2	B	but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	9	A	that is right.
2959	2	B	uh, being entirely different people.
2959	2	B	i had dinner monday night with a vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had.
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	2	B	that is a long time to suffer.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	2	A	and they, they really need,
2959	2	A	everybody that has, that has stood there,
2959	5	A	it's,
2959	5	A	when i-,
2959	2	A	in vietnam i think it was much closer contact.
2959	2	A	you stand there with a rifle and blow a, a piece of somebody apart,
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	or blow their head off,
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	2	A	and that has to affect you if you are human, you know.
2959	9	B	oh, yeah,
2959	6	B	yeah.
2959	2	A	so they had to
2959	5	B	i can't, uh,
2959	7	A	work all that, that anger out, and the, and the nightmares that come along with it.
2959	9	B	oh, yeah.
2959	9	B	you bet,
2959	2	A	i do not,
2959	9	B	you bet.
2959	7	A	i do not  really think that anybody can ever for-, forget that,
2959	2	A	but they can, they can reason  and,
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	7	A	and  try to adjust to, to why they were there.
2959	6	B	yeah.
2959	2	B	well, you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now.
2959	4	B	they say, "well, we're,
2959	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
2959	7	B	going to listen to this and we are going to look at this, find out what our mistakes were, and we are not going to make them again."
2959	2	B	but that does not undo the ones that were done.
2959	2	B	and that is what makes the veterans angry.
2959	6	A	right.
2959	4	B	and i cannot blame them.
2959	4	B	i do not know a solution.
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	4	B	but i sure cannot blame them for being angry.
2959	2	B	on the other hand, you know, you can be angry about something for a very long time,
2959	2	B	or you can say, "well, that is the way it is," and go on with your life.
2959	5	B	uh,
2959	6	A	right.
2959	4	B	for the most part, i wish that it had not happened.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	4	B	but it did.
2959	2	A	and that,
2959	5	B	so,
2959	7	A	and that was,   that was  in the, in the era when kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything,
2959	7	B	that is right.
2959	7	A	you know.
2959	4	A	and, and, and they f-, initially got into it because of eisenhower.
2959	2	A	and he just, he did not want to be in it any more than, than what we started out in august with desert storm.
2959	9	B	oh, yeah.
2959	2	A	and then it just blew up into the war.
2959	2	B	well, it has been that way for a very, very long time, though.
2959	4	B	i can remember when i was in the sixth grade,
2959	4	B	and that was many years ago.
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	4	B	we were reading about the french
2959	6	A	french, yeah.
2959	7	B	struggling with that
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	7	B	in southeast asia.
2959	4	B	so, and, and, and the asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on.
2959	6	A	right, yeah.
2959	2	B	there, there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world.
2959	6	A	uh-huh
2959	16	A	<barking>.
2959	28	B	i really, i do not know,
2959	2	B	i-, we should not have maybe gotten involved.
2959	2	B	but if we did, we certainly should have supported our people who were there.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	2	B	more so supported them when they got home.
2959	6	A	right.
2959	2	B	and, uh, i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part.
2959	9	A	exactly.
2959	4	B	and i, i saw the movie,
2959	16	A	<Cough> <throat_clearing>.
2959	7	B	born on the fourth of july,
2959	2	B	and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times.
2959	6	A	uh-huh.
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	2	A	more than, what was, apocalypse now .
2959	6	B	uh-huh.
2959	13	B	well, dudley, have we pretty well discussed the subject?
2959	6	A	yeah.
2959	2	A	i think so.
2959	2	B	well, i think so.
2959	12	B	i enjoyed talking to you.
2959	12	A	yes,
2959	12	A	it was nice talking to you.
2959	12	B	uh-huh.
2959	12	A	okay,
2959	12	A	bye-bye.
2959	12	B	bye-bye.
2981	0	A	okay,
2981	20	A	well, what's your opinion about capital punishment?
2981	2	B	well, cathy, i think that, uh, capital punishment certainly has a place in our society, um, maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just can't afford to have repeated, even in the remote chance of repetition.
2981	3	A	right,
2981	2	A	i think i would agree with you on that, too.
2981	2	A	i, i can't see any point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation, uh, keeping them, you know, paying for them to live in prison for years and years and years when you could probably just eliminate the problem.
2981	2	A	maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped.
2981	17	B	that might be true,
2981	5	B	um, i'm,
2981	8	B	what i don't know, is where do we draw the line.
2981	6	A	right.
2981	13	B	uh, do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime,
2981	15	B	or do we extend it beyond that?
2981	6	A	uh-huh,
2981	32	A	beyond murder or just beyond like first degree murder?
2981	27	B	well, either, you know.
2981	4	B	uh, i have a, a nine year old daughter,
2981	2	B	and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes, that, that i would consider basis for murder.
2981	6	A	yeah.
2981	6	A	yeah,
2981	2	A	well that really gets into a sticky issue.
2981	4	A	uh, i could see that too.
2981	2	A	i think there's probably things i could think of short of murder that someone, i think someone would probably deserve to be killed for.
2981	9	A	but, gosh,
2981	8	A	and who's going to decide which is how bad, you know,
2981	2	A	something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me,
2981	2	A	and, uh, it's gets into a pretty sticky issue.
2981	3	B	yes,
2981	3	B	it does.
2981	2	B	a lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and, um, to what's allowable and where are we.
2981	6	A	right.
2981	2	B	uh, you know, if we were, lived in a different country, then murder is not so bad.
2981	6	A	yeah.
2981	2	B	but over here, where we're promised the civil liberties of purs-, life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, then taking that away is a, a heinous act.
2981	6	A	yeah,
2981	24	A	in some eyes.
2981	2	A	i think some people give up that .
2981	2	A	i think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than, than what most people think of them as.
2981	4	A	i don't know what, um, texas's criteria for capital murder is,  do, capital punishment is,
2981	13	A	do you know?
2981	13	A	are there some set guidelines, like only under these circumstances?
2981	28	B	i don't know.
2981	2	B	i believe it's, uh, at the discretion of the judge or jury.
2981	6	A	uh-huh.
2981	4	A	i used to live in virginia,
2981	4	A	and i know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only, um, if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder.
2981	2	A	those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty, which i think is a little too limited.
2981	3	B	i tend to agree with you there.
2981	2	B	um, my belief is that, is that, um, any crime that's freely committed, you know
2981	5	B	freedom of choice --
2981	6	A	uh-huh.
2981	2	B	these people had a choice of committing this crime, that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life
2981	6	A	yeah.
2981	7	B	such as rape, deserves punishment by death.
2981	4	B	but then i'm also told that i'm a pretty harsh person.
2981	6	A	yeah,
2981	4	A	in general terms i'm not so harsh,
2981	4	A	but then whenever i hear of a specific case, you know, where someone did something, then it's like, yeah, put it to them .
2981	4	A	so, i think i probably tend to be a little bit harsh, too, as far as that goes.
2981	5	A	because,
2981	5	A	yeah,
2981	3	A	i think you're right,
2981	2	A	that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime,
2981	2	A	they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life,
2981	5	A	just beca-, you know,
2981	2	A	they ruin someone else's life.
2981	6	B	all right,
2981	4	B	i can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a store for food
2981	6	A	right.
2981	7	B	than a person who commits a crime to, either for the thrill of committing the crime or the thrill, the feeling of power that they get from it, or to acquire drugs for some other, i mean acquire funds for some other illegal activity.
2981	6	A	uh-huh.
2981	2	B	you know, that second group of people falls into the group that i say give up their rights,
2981	4	B	the, the first guy, you know i just assumed it was a guy, the first person,
2981	16	A	<Laughter>.
2981	7	B	that went out to rob a store for food, that to me is, is a different set of circumstances, where he, he deserves help instead of, uh, loss of life.
2981	6	A	right.
2981	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
2981	6	A	yeah,
2981	29	A	he didn't go out with the intent of hurting someone else.
2981	3	B	that's right
2981	5	B	or with the,
2981	7	A	or with no regard for someone else's well being.
2981	8	A	what about, uh, like teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that. say fifteen, sixteen year old.
2981	13	A	would you consider, uh, capital punishment for them?
2981	2	B	i think i would probably lower the age to about fourteen.
2981	6	A	uh-huh.
2981	5	B	there's some,
2981	28	B	and i, i certainly don't know myself,
2981	2	B	but somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include the, the consideration of, of long term consequences
2981	6	A	right.
2981	7	B	begins.
2981	6	A	yeah,
2981	24	A	what age they're accountable,
2981	13	B	you know,
2981	7	A	for their actions.
2981	7	B	i have an eighteen year old,
2981	4	B	and, uh, well he's nineteen now,
2981	4	B	and i don't think that i saw it in him until maybe last year,
2981	16	A	<Laughter>.
2981	4	B	and i have an eleven year old and a nine year old,
2981	4	B	and i don't, don't see it in them yet,
2981	4	B	but i'm, i'm not sure where it begins.
2981	6	A	yeah,
2981	2	A	i know that they are lowering the age of, uh, whatever is considered a minor.
2981	2	A	i think the kids, certain kids have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be,
2981	5	A	like,
2981	4	A	i think i read about a boy that was nine or ten, that got mad at some playmates and went in and got a gun and just opened fire on them,
2981	4	A	and they were trying to charge him as a,
2989	2	A	well, wayne, i, uh, feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children, and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available.
2989	1	A	how do you feel about it?
2989	3	B	well, yeah,
2989	2	B	i feel much the same way.
2989	4	B	i've, uh, two kids right now
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	4	B	one is two and a half
2989	4	B	and one's nine months,
2989	2	B	and, uh, that age, of course, everything you do they're trying to learn to do,
2989	2	B	and so, uh, it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn, you know, that, that they need to learn at the age, you know
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	7	B	reading, and, uh, reading and playing nice with others, and that sort of thing.
2989	6	A	yeah,
2989	4	A	we went through this with our children, and now with our grandchildren,
2989	4	A	and i've always tried to do things with them, uh, like, when you're at the little league, helping out even though i'm not a good athlete myself,
2989	4	A	i was able to help the coach in, in just controlling the kids, if nothing else,
2989	4	A	and we've always, uh, oh tried to take our children and no-, now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to.
2989	2	A	i think that's just part of their overall educational process, is to get out and see and do things.
2989	3	B	right,
2989	3	B	uh-huh.
2989	6	A	yeah,
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	5	A	and so, it's uh,
2989	4	A	we have, uh, lived several places around the u s
2989	4	A	and we have, where we've lived, we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area,
2989	4	A	like when we lived in tennessee, we, we took them to washington, d c to see all the capitol and, and things like that when they were small.
2989	4	A	and it's just, uh, it's helps, i think, the children to, when they're learning in school, to say, well, i've been there and i've seen that.
2989	6	B	right.
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	6	B	uh-huh.
2989	6	A	yeah,
2989	5	A	so, uh, that's the type,
2989	3	B	yeah,
2989	2	B	it certainly does, because, uh, you know, the things in the books seem so dead to the kids, you know, unless they've actually been there or whatever,
2989	4	B	because i remember our family, well, we, we, we went everywhere.
2989	4	B	and, uh, seeing new england and, uh, being on plymouth rock and stuff like that  was --
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	7	B	really made  the whole thing more, uh, visual.
2989	6	A	yes.
2989	4	B	and we could, uh, read the things in the history books and understand what they said, when it was like, we need food, we need to raise food quickly
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	7	B	because this place gets very cold very soon.
2989	6	A	yeah,
2989	4	A	we've, uh,
2989	16	B	<Cough>.
2989	7	A	gone through that, uh,
2989	4	A	i remember my parents didn't do all those type things,
2989	4	A	and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that.
2989	4	A	and even now with my grandchildren, i feel it's a very important thing to be done.
2989	3	B	right,
2989	2	B	because if, uh, kids don't look up to you, or, or, ca-, can't feel they can spend time with you, they're going to find someone else
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	2	B	and uh, you know, nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to, emulating or whatever.
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	4	A	well, i can remember one of the things i'm most proud of is, uh, when my son was,
2989	4	A	i think it was in the sixth grade,
2989	4	A	they had to write a, a little brief autobiography of themselves, and about what they had done and what they wanted to do,
2989	4	A	and i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to, uh, have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him.
2989	16	B	<Laughter>.
2989	4	A	a real point of pride with me.
2989	6	B	yeah,
2989	3	B	that is nice.
2989	6	A	yeah
2989	2	A	excuse me, it sounds like we both have colds.
2989	3	B	yeah,
2989	4	B	well, it's, um, well, it's, uh, ten o'clock here in falls church, virginia.
2989	6	A	oh.
2989	4	B	so that the only reason i'm home is because i'm home with a cold .
2989	5	A	oh, well, we're
2989	4	B	and the wife says, well, you need something to do,
2989	33	B	talk to a guy on the phone.
2989	6	A	yeah,
2989	4	A	well, i'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of dallas, texas.
2989	16	B	<Laughter>.
2989	4	A	so, we're kind of far apart here.
2989	6	B	yeah .
2989	4	A	this is a very interesting program i, i heard about here on this,
2989	4	A	and when i signed up for it, it, uh, looked like it could be, make a real contribution in participating.
2989	3	B	right.
2989	3	B	yeah,
2989	4	B	i'm an electrical engineer by trade
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	7	B	uh, here in virginia.
2989	4	B	likewise, we, uh, we do some projects every now and then.
2989	4	B	we like to get support from, uh, other, other companies as well.
2989	6	A	yeah.
2989	4	A	i'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan .
2989	16	B	<Laughter>.
2989	4	A	so, trying to work myself out of a job .
2989	16	B	<Laughter>.
2989	4	A	but, it's been an interesting, uh, roughly, oh, nine months here,
2989	4	A	and, uh
2989	6	B	oh.
2989	7	A	again, this is our home area.
2989	4	A	we've lived here about seventeen years,
2989	5	A	and it's, uh,
2989	4	A	we enjoy living here.
2989	4	A	it's where we originally started out,
2989	4	A	and we've lived up north for a while in chicago and over in tennessee.
2989	4	A	so, wound up back about two hundred miles aware, away from where we started out.
2989	6	B	yep .
2989	4	A	well, uh, that's about all i can think to talk about right now.
2989	12	A	it's been a pleasure talking with you.
2989	12	B	okay.
2989	38	A	thank you.
2989	40	B	right.
2989	12	A	bye.
2989	12	B	bye-bye.
3015	2	A	uh, national health insurance, i think, is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	6	A	yeah,
3015	4	A	because, uh, the articles that i've read regarding national health service in canada and england has indicated that, uh,
3015	5	A	what i-,
3015	4	A	stay, stay in line for, uh, four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	6	B	yeah,
3015	4	B	i'm, i'm sort of mixed on this.
3015	2	B	i think that the, the answer may lie in, uh, not in so much a, uh, national kind of medical thing that li-, like england has but more of a, um, national insurance, uh, sort of clearinghouse or whatever.
3015	2	B	i think that, uh, too many, uh,
3015	2	B	the problem with, with right now is w-, that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through
3015	4	B	and, and i think that, i think you, you mentioned canada.
3015	4	B	i think that they have a system where, uh, they, the government deals with the, with,
3015	4	B	i mean, you, you go to whoever you want but file through one, one s-, particular,
3015	6	A	um, i see.
3015	7	B	uh, setup
3015	4	B	and that way they, they are able to reduce prices because they've, you know, it's, it's all one, one centralized thing.
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	2	A	well, i, i think that, uh, again having gone through a period when i was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own,
3015	16	B	<<Very faint>>  <throat_clearing>.
3015	7	A	if you don't have a company supporting you in the, uh, picking up the major portion of your health insurance,
3015	6	B	uh-huh.
3015	7	A	the cost is p-, almost prohibitive.
3015	3	B	right.
3015	4	B	uh, i, i was listening, uh, on the radio the other day
3015	4	B	and they were talking that, s-, s-, something like this,
3015	4	B	i think they were talking about the fact that, um, the money that could be saved, um, in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, um, could, uh, could,
3015	2	B	they could make it, i-, i-, provide health insurance to, to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save.
3015	3	A	yeah.
3015	4	A	uh, we're currently, where i'm working now, under blue cross.
3015	16	B	.
3015	4	A	i don't know what the total cost of the program is
3015	4	A	but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	4	A	so i assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably,
3015	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3015	7	A	three fifty to four hundred.
3015	4	A	they're probably picking up about half of it.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	2	A	and that's a pretty good policy,
3015	2	A	but if you had something like one of these, uh,
3015	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3015	7	A	health maintenance programs,
3015	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3015	4	A	or one of, whatever the type name is,
3015	6	B	yeah,
3015	24	B	h m o.
3015	7	A	h m o, uh, where the, uh, where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest.
3015	16	B	<<Very faint>> <throat_clearing>.
3015	7	A	if you tried to buy something like that, i'm prob-, it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month for just the cost of something.
3015	3	B	yeah,
3015	2	B	and they're, they're fairly expensive.
3015	4	B	i, i, um, i ha-, i was on an h m o, uh, up until last year
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	7	B	and, uh, through work.
3015	5	B	and it was,
3015	4	B	i forget how much i paid a month
3015	4	B	but it was much, you know, is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care.
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	4	B	and, uh, the reason i, i quite was because of, uh, not because i didn't like it,
3015	4	B	i, i really kind of did.
3015	4	B	uh, the reason i quite was just because the, the doctor a, a certain doctor that we en-, enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that h m o
3015	4	B	so we, my wife decided she wanted to, to stay with that doctor,
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	4	B	so, we went to the, to  the, the  medical insurance that we have at, here at work,
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	5	B	and, uh, i, uh, i like the, i like the convenience of the h m o in, in a certain respect because it, uh, even though you're,
3015	2	B	once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem.
3015	2	B	you know, a lot of people complain saying well, i don't want to, uh, have to be told who i need to go to
3015	2	B	but, you know, if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference.
3015	3	A	yeah,
3015	3	A	that's right.
3015	7	B	because you can, you know, if, if you find someone you really like
3015	4	B	and then, we did find several good doctors.
3015	4	B	and, um, like you say it's, uh, five dollars an office visit.
3015	4	B	and, um, my wife was in the hospital had our, had our daughter
3015	4	B	and i think her total bill was around three hundred dollars
3015	9	A	oh, goodness.
3015	7	B	for everything.
3015	4	B	uh, that included, uh, you know, the doctors, the time, the, the hospital a-, an-, everything.
3015	29	A	delivery room and everything.
3015	7	B	delivery room and everything.
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	4	B	include-, including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay
3015	4	B	but that was, that was still included in that pr-, that cost
3015	5	B	so.
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	2	B	it's really nice because they, th-, you know, their, their attitude is different than, than a regular, uh, insurance, uh, health insurance, uh, the, in, in a, h m o, you know,
3015	2	B	they're trying to prevent a problem by, by keeping the cost down at the front end,
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	7	B	you know, and have you come in, you know,
3015	4	B	they, they charge five dollars
3015	4	B	a s-,
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	7	B	you know, pop,
3015	2	B	you're more willing to go in and try,
3015	16	A	.
3015	7	B	to take care of a problem before it grows big.
3015	2	A	as to a company's benefit,
3015	16	B	<<Very faint>> <throat_clearing>.
3015	7	A	to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job.
3015	6	B	yeah.
3015	2	A	because they don't have to worry about going in and, and paying,
3015	16	B	<<Very faint>> <throat_clearing>.
3015	7	A	uh, seventy-five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	5	A	that's a,
3015	3	B	yeah,
3015	4	B	i, i, uh, i, i really liked it.
3015	4	B	we both, my wife and i both did.
3015	2	B	you, you don't have to worry about filling out forms, uh, you know, for reimbursement and all or, you know, getting paid eight percent of, of whatever.
3015	2	B	you just pay the, the five dollars right then
3015	2	B	and then you're done with it.
3015	3	A	yeah.
3015	2	A	but here again the, the doctor's practices in hospitals,
3015	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3015	7	A	have gon-, become fairly sizable businesses under themselves now.
3015	6	B	uh-huh.
3015	2	A	uh, you take a hospital, uh, the physical plant itself,
3015	2	A	you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building, uh, when the e-, rooms are empty.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	2	A	so, they spread the costs out over, uh, all the patient costs
3015	2	A	and, uh, that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	7	A	the horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and, uh, it being,
3015	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3015	7	A	a four thousand dollar bill.
3015	5	B	well, they,  and you know, they're  also p-,
3015	5	B	take-,
3015	2	B	they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay.
3015	6	A	right.
3015	2	B	you know, they, they get a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, people who are j-, just have to be there and can't afford it
3015	2	B	and so they, they know they're not going to  get pa-,
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	7	B	you know, get money  from them
3015	2	B	so they,
3015	6	A	yeah.
3015	7	B	have to absorb it somewhere else.
3015	3	A	yeah.
3015	4	A	my daughter and son-in-law had a baby,
3015	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3015	7	A	here about, uh, what,
3015	4	A	he-, he'll be three in august.
3015	6	B	uh-huh.
3015	4	A	and, uh, their insurance plan that they're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	4	A	and like she went in,
3015	4	A	she had the baby
3015	4	A	and she was out in two days time.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	4	A	and it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital,
3015	6	B	right.
3015	4	A	the, the deductibles didn't apply.
3015	6	B	right.
3015	2	A	and so that's one way, one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by, uh,
3015	33	A	okay,
3015	33	A	if you'll shorten your stay then we will, uh, waive the deductible.
3015	3	B	right.
3015	4	B	our, our insurance is, uh, is doing something similar where they're also going to mor-,
3046	25	A	good morning.
3046	25	B	hi.
3046	25	A	my name is jean.
3046	25	B	i'm tina.
3046	20	A	oh, where you from tina?
3046	4	B	i live in garland, texas.
3046	14	A	oh, garland, texas,
3046	4	A	i'm in pennsylvania.
3046	4	B	oh, my lands, you're the farthest person i've ever talked to.
3046	18	A	really? .
3046	19	B	yeah.
3046	13	A	do you work for texas instruments?
3046	36	B	my husband does.
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	6	B	yeah.
3046	13	B	probably most people you talk to do, huh?
3046	23	A	most of them do.
3046	4	A	now, i don't have anybody that works for t i,
3046	4	A	but, uh
3046	6	B	huh.
3046	7	A	my son works for a computer company, the national institute of s-, s-, something,
3046	4	A	i don't know what .
3046	6	B	i see,
3046	9	B	well that's neat.
3046	4	A	so, i guess we're supposed to talk about foods today.
3046	3	B	yeah,
3046	11	B	i guess you have to push one, though.
3046	3	A	yes,
3046	3	A	uh-huh.
3046	6	B	okay.
3046	13	A	you ready?
3046	19	B	yeah.
3046	14	A	okay.
3046	4	A	uh, foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that.
3046	6	B	yeah,
3046	21	B	i guess so,
3046	13	B	it may be interesting, because probably here in texas, we may eat a little differently than you do up there .
3046	39	A	well, i don't know,
3046	4	A	my brother lives down east of us down there,
3046	4	A	and i don't think they ate all that much different .
3046	6	B	oh, really.
3046	2	A	uh, i think as long as you plan your basic foods,
3046	2	A	course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more.
3046	3	B	yeah,
3046	3	B	that's true.
3046	6	A	uh.
3046	4	B	well, uh, the thing that i found interesting,
3046	4	B	my husband and i lived up in washington state for awhile
3046	6	A	uh-huh,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	and up there, of course they ate a lot of sea food,
3046	6	A	oh, uh-huh.
3046	7	B	and that kind of thing,
3046	2	B	and down here, sea food is pretty expensive, because,
3046	6	A	right.
3046	7	B	you have to ship it a long way to get it .
3046	3	A	yeah,
3046	2	A	and it's not as good as if it's fresh.
3046	3	B	right,
3046	4	B	and, and, uh, and, but here, we eat a lot of like mexican foods,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	and, um, up there there was no, no place that we went tasted like real mexican food to me.
3046	18	A	is that right?
3046	19	B	yeah,
3046	4	B	it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could,
3046	4	B	but it just,
3046	6	A	yeah,
3046	7	B	didn't taste right.
3046	3	A	well, they probably were trying to do the best they could.
3046	6	B	yeah.
3046	30	A	yeah.
3046	4	B	and, uh, down here, we eat a lot more fried foods, i think.
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	like chicken fried steak,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	7	B	is a real big thing.
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	up there, uh, it was hardly ever heard of
3046	4	B	and,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	7	B	we drink ice tea with every meal,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea .
3046	6	A	yeah,
3046	2	A	well they do in the summertime,
3046	2	A	i think that
3046	18	B	really?
3046	7	A	tea is big in the summertime mostly.
3046	6	B	yeah.
3046	2	A	of course, you have warmer weather most of the time.
3046	6	B	right.
3046	5	A	so, uh,
3046	3	B	yeah,
3046	2	B	it never gets real cold.
3046	6	A	yeah.
3046	5	A	so, i,
3046	6	B	yeah,
3046	4	B	but when, when we have a dinner party around here, i think a lot of the time a mexican menu is something real popular.
3046	18	A	is that right?
3046	19	B	yeah.
3046	4	B	i know that, um, i do a lot of planning with our church,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	and a lot of the times when we get together, well everybody will bring a mexican dish
3046	4	B	or.
3046	6	A	uh-huh,
3046	6	A	uh-huh
3046	7	B	and  italian food is real big too.
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	29	A	more like covered dishes for those type of dinners.
3046	3	B	uh-huh.
3046	3	B	yeah.
3046	3	B	yeah.
3046	16	A	.
3046	1	B	how about you,
3046	20	B	what is real popular up there?
3046	27	A	well, i don't know,
3046	39	A	just about anything .
3046	18	B	oh, really.
3046	19	A	yeah,
3046	4	A	we, we really, uh, use most anything.
3046	5	A	i, uh, i think like parties and that though are,
3046	4	A	well, like we had a dinner party here, here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party .
3046	14	B	oh.
3046	4	A	but, basically, we tried, you know, included all the basic, uh, foods that you are supposed to have in a meal .
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	4	A	your, uh, bread family and your,
3046	4	A	or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and ,
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	7	A	ham and bake potatoes, uh,
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	4	A	uh, something from each, each area that you're supposed to choose from.
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	4	A	and, uh, we, we, we ourselves are into the wok cooking,
3046	4	A	you know they been advertising that
3046	4	A	and,
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	7	A	we've really been enjoying those, uh, meals.
3046	9	B	well, that's good.
3046	2	A	they have a lot of vegetable to them,
3046	2	A	and, uh,
3046	6	B	uh-huh,
3046	6	B	right.
3046	7	A	they really are very good.
3046	3	B	oh, yes.
3046	4	B	i, i love that kind of cooking.
3046	4	B	my, uh, unfortunately, i am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things .
3046	13	A	is he a meat and potato person?
3046	23	B	right.
3046	4	B	they.
3046	4	A	well, all our family is, is gone.
3046	4	A	they are out on their own.
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	4	A	and, uh.
3046	2	B	that probably makes it easier,
3046	5	B	but.
3046	7	A	it, it's much different
3046	5	A	and, uh.
3046	6	B	yeah.
3046	4	B	we find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese
3046	5	B	and,  uh,
3046	6	A	uh-huh,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	7	B	and  of course ,
3046	4	A	well, my husband didn't like that,
3046	5	A	so we, us kids,
3046	4	A	we had five children
3046	4	A	and we ate that when he, he wasn't going to be home for supper,
3046	6	B	right.
3046	4	A	that's what we had .
3046	6	B	yeah,
3046	4	B	well, that's pretty much what we do,
3046	4	B	if dad's not coming home, we have macaroni and cheese,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	7	B	or something.
3046	4	B	but, they like, uh, spaghetti.
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	you know, that's one meal,
3046	6	A	uh, yeah.
3046	7	B	i can fix
3046	4	B	and the whole family eats.
3046	5	B	but, uh, there are several things that,
3046	4	B	well as a matter of fact, i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time, because.
3046	2	A	oh, those always go good.
3046	3	B	yeah,
3046	4	B	the children love them,
3046	6	A	yeah.
3046	2	B	and, uh, they are real easy to cook
3046	4	B	and,
3046	6	A	yeah.
3046	7	B	that way, whatever meat we have, if they don't like it, well,
3046	4	B	and my girls don't like beef,
3046	28	B	i,
3046	6	A	oh really.
3046	7	B	don't know,
3046	2	A	well maybe.
3046	28	B	i guess,
3046	7	A	that's good the way, way the things are going.
3046	3	B	well, yeah,
3046	5	B	it could be, bec-, they don't,
3046	2	B	i think it's the texture of it,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	2	B	but it takes more chewing .
3046	3	A	right.
3046	2	A	children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers,
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	7	A	and that,
3046	2	A	and it is easier to chew.
3046	3	B	right.
3046	3	B	right.
3046	4	B	so they're not too much into beef.
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	my husband and i eat more beef than we should,
3046	4	B	but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them .
3046	6	A	right.
3046	4	A	we don't really have, uh, you know, entertain too much.
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	13	A	i don't know if you do or not,
3046	4	A	but we, we don't a whole lot,
3046	4	A	we're more, once in a while, but mostly family,
3046	6	B	yeah.
3046	7	A	activities.
3046	23	B	well, most of the entertaining we do is church associated.
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	we have a real tiny little house,
3046	4	B	we don't have room really,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	7	B	to have people here.
3046	6	A	uh-huh,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	but, we do get together for wh-, fellowships at our church,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	and, my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that.
3046	6	A	yeah.
3046	5	B	and,
3046	9	A	well that's good.
3046	3	B	yeah,
3046	3	B	it is
3046	4	B	and it's fun to, uh,
3046	4	B	i like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish.
3046	6	A	yeah,
3046	4	A	we do a lot of that take ,
3046	6	B	yeah.
3046	7	A	things to church
3046	4	A	and our homemakers meet at the church also,
3046	4	A	and, uh,
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	7	A	that's what we do  mostly,
3046	6	B	yeah.
3046	7	A	most  of the time for that.
3046	6	B	yeah.
3046	4	A	so, you don't really include any certain food groups,
3046	4	A	you just bring,
3046	6	B	right.
3046	7	A	what you like .
3046	3	B	that's right .
3046	4	A	sometimes you have all desserts,
3046	4	A	sometimes,
3046	6	B	yeah .
3046	7	A	you have all vegetables .
3046	6	B	yeah,
3046	3	B	that's true,
3046	2	B	that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever,
3046	6	A	yeah.
3046	7	B	you, uh, like best.
3046	4	A	but, it doesn't happen very often,
3046	4	A	usually you get a pretty wide variety
3046	4	A	and you can, you can ,
3046	6	B	uh-huh.
3046	7	A	have pretty good meals,
3046	6	B	yeah.
3046	7	A	from one of those.
3046	3	B	yeah.
3046	4	B	i remember one time we had a progressive dinner.
3046	9	A	oh, those are fun.
3046	5	B	it's the only time that ever.
3046	3	B	yeah
3046	3	B	they are.
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	4	B	but it's the only time tha-, i can remember that,
3046	4	B	i can't remember what food it was
3046	4	B	i, it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with.
3046	4	B	several people were supposed to bring,
3046	6	A	uh, uh-huh.
3046	7	B	you know, each, like, uh, a, an appetizer,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	7	B	and a main dish and a dessert.
3046	4	B	and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers
3046	4	B	and,
3046	6	A	(( oh, uh-huh
3046	6	A	)) ,
3046	7	B	but  when we came to the main, main dish plate,
3046	7	A	oh.
3046	7	B	there was only like two or three .
3046	13	A	was there enough to go around? .
3046	36	B	well, not really,
3046	4	B	you know we all took real tiny little portions,
3046	6	A	uh-huh.
3046	7	B	and, uh, were kind of angry with whoever it was,
3046	4	B	we were not sure who didn't show up with the food .
3046	6	A	yeah,
3046	2	A	that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually ,
3046	3	B	yes.
3046	2	A	and you know they know better.
3046	6	B	right.
3046	2	A	even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook .
3046	3	B	right.
3046	2	B	either, either go ahead and fix your dish
3046	2	B	or call someone that can.
3046	3	A	right.
3046	3	A	right.
3046	6	B	i know it.
3046	9	B	well, that sounds neat,
3046	4	B	i can't, uh, believe you're so far away,
3046	4	B	but you sound so close.
3046	4	A	they said that we could share, we share,
3046	4	B	it sounds like you're here in dallas.
3046	7	A	a recipe
3046	4	A	but, i'm up at my daughter's,
3046	4	A	i don't even have any of my recipes with me.
3046	6	B	oh.
3046	5	A	uh, you know ,
3046	4	B	i don't know if i have anything handy,
3046	4	B	we were just about, we were getting ready to go swimming,
3046	6	A	oh.
3046	4	B	and we're waiting on my sister.
3046	9	A	oh, great.
3046	35	B	cara, hold on just a second
3046	4	B	as a matter of fact, my,
3046	24	A	they are ready to go.
3046	7	B	little one is hollering .
3046	12	A	well, we probably, have we talked long enough
3046	5	A	i,
3046	12	B	i think it probably has been.
3046	12	A	okay,
3046	5	A	so i'll let,
3046	12	B	so, i've enjoyed talking to you.
3046	12	A	oh, same here.
3046	12	A	you have a good day.
3046	12	B	thank you.
3046	12	B	thanks for calling.
3046	12	A	uh-huh.
3046	12	B	# bye-bye. #
3046	12	A	# bye-bye. #
3072	0	B	okay.
3072	30	A	okay,
3072	20	A	where have you all been on vacation recently?
3072	4	B	recently,
3072	4	B	my most recent trip was last year,
3072	4	B	and that was detroit.
3072	32	A	detroit?
3072	19	B	yeah.
3072	13	A	is that a nice vacation spot?
3072	36	B	well, it wasn't really.
3072	4	B	it was, um, uh, to see an old relative.
3072	14	A	right,
3072	14	A	okay.
3072	4	B	and it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.
3072	6	A	right.
3072	13	A	so you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?
3072	26	B	no.
3072	4	B	the only thing that i, i visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is cancun, mexico.
3072	9	A	ooh, that would be nice.
3072	2	B	and that was real nice. uh,
3072	13	A	did you scuba dive there?
3072	26	B	no,
3072	4	B	we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.
3072	9	A	ooh, that would be nice.
3072	6	B	yeah,
3072	4	B	and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit,
3072	9	A	oh, that would be enjoyable.
3072	7	B	from our daily routine.
3072	6	A	right,
3072	6	A	yeah,
3072	9	A	that's,
3072	6	B	huh.
3072	7	A	a nice break.
3072	4	A	i haven't been on vacation in a while either.
3072	4	A	um, usually when we go, we go to colorado, to estes park area.
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	7	A	which is up kind of near denver.
3072	6	B	yes.
3072	7	A	and, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the texas heat, that kind of thing.
3072	9	B	oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.
3072	4	A	so it's a lot of fun.
3072	4	A	i worked up there last summer,
3072	4	A	so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the,
3072	9	B	oh, well, that's nice.
3072	7	A	whole summer long .
3072	6	B	yeah.
3072	4	A	worked at a camp there,
3072	4	A	and so i got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains.
3072	4	A	so that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation.
3072	4	B	well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,
3072	4	B	and that's canoeing.
3072	6	A	oh.
3072	4	B	and, uh, they've been to the guadalupe river,
3072	4	B	and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, i guess colorado,
3072	4	B	and they've really enjoyed it.
3072	9	A	that's nice.
3072	4	A	we,  um,
3072	4	B	it's a whole new,
3072	7	A	we  canoed up in arkansas at the buffalo river.
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	4	A	and that's the best place that i've ever canoed.
3072	5	B	huh.
3072	2	A	it's really, really pretty.
3072	4	A	i was a little kid then,
3072	5	A	and we to have, uh,
3072	4	A	we stayed at some park
3072	4	A	and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night,
3072	4	A	and he would give a little talk about mountain things.
3072	4	A	you know, i think he wasn't a real mountain man,
3072	4	A	but we were pretty convinced he was a full,
3072	6	B	sure.
3072	7	A	hermit who lived up in,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	7	A	the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,
3072	4	A	and we would have to, we'd
3072	4	A	and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found
3072	2	A	and,
3072	9	B	oh, that's neat.
3072	7	A	that's a good family place to go,
3072	6	B	sure.
3072	2	A	and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening,
3072	2	A	but it wasn't,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	7	A	you know, too easy either.
3072	2	A	it was like,
3072	2	B	well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too,
3072	2	B	and i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,
3072	3	A	that's true.
3072	2	B	and i think they really it really pen-, penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it.
3072	6	A	uh-huh.
3072	7	B	because it's something you weren't forced to do ,
3072	6	A	right.
3072	2	B	so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.
3072	6	A	yeah.
3072	2	B	and you're more receptive.
3072	9	A	well, that's good.
3072	21	A	well, we, um, let's see,
3072	4	A	the only other place i've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to texoma and things like that.
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	4	A	and then i went to england
3072	9	B	oh, that's exciting.
3072	7	A	a few years ago.
3072	4	A	i was a,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	7	A	student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in london.
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	4	A	and that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place
3072	4	A	and it's, there's not a language barrier
3072	5	A	so you don't,
3072	4	A	i mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those english words that you just don't exactly know what they mean,
3072	2	A	and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,
3072	2	A	but it's, it was really fun.
3072	4	A	i, i, i really enjoyed that.
3072	4	A	i'm probably going back there to work,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	7	A	for a year.
3072	4	B	well, i had a friend that, uh, visited england not, well, i think it's been probably two years now,
3072	4	B	but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to england,
3072	4	B	because she really has a great desire to do that,
3072	4	B	because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.
3072	2	A	it, it's really nice.
3072	4	A	i would, i would spend all my time in london,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	7	A	or most of my time,
3072	4	A	and that's it was really different being in a big city,
3072	4	A	because i don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot
3072	6	B	uh-huh,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	4	A	and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are
3072	4	A	and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which i thought i would just hate,
3072	4	A	but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.
3072	6	B	uh-huh,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	4	A	you could just  kind of  ,
3072	24	B	do your own thing.
3072	7	A	kind of  walk around and observe,
3072	6	B	yeah.
3072	4	A	i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	4	A	and i had a great time doing that.
3072	2	A	it was really interesting.
3072	9	B	that's wonderful.
3072	2	B	there's a lot out there to see,
3072	6	A	yeah,
3072	9	A	i know,
3072	9	B	i'll say .
3072	4	A	i keep wanting to get up to,
3072	4	A	i haven't, i haven't been anywhere else outside the united states.
3072	4	A	i haven't been to mexico or canada or,
3072	4	B	well, i lived across the street almost from canada .
3072	6	A	oh.
3072	2	B	so that was, that, that's a nice place.
3072	2	B	canada is very nice.
3072	6	A	yeah,
3072	2	A	that would be nice.
3072	4	A	i had a friend from there.
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	4	A	then i, i'd love to go somewhere in asia,
3072	4	A	but i'd have to have a tour guide with me to
3072	3	B	oh, yes,
3072	3	B	absolutely.
3072	7	A	help with all the language and all that.
3072	6	B	sure,
3072	29	B	somebody that knows their way around.
3072	3	A	so, yeah,
3072	4	A	that's why, that's why england was nice.
3072	4	A	even, we traveled in europe for about a week,
3072	4	A	and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the,
3072	4	A	most the places we went, we went to germany and switzerland and,
3072	13	B	well, you've been quite a few places there .
3072	19	A	yeah,
3072	4	A	we have.
3072	4	A	we .
3072	9	B	once you think about it, huh.
3072	7	A	we did,   we whirlwinded  through,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	7	A	europe.
3072	4	A	it was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day,
3072	4	A	and you slept on the train at night.
3072	9	B	oh, that's great.
3072	5	A	but there wasn't a,
3072	2	A	it was strange,
3072	2	A	it was kind of sad,
3072	4	A	there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in germany knew english
3072	4	A	and everyone in switzerland,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	7	A	knew english.
3072	9	B	that's great.
3072	4	A	so we were kind of pitiful.
3072	4	A	we found one restaurant we were in and got seated,
3072	4	A	and then no one knew english in there,
3072	4	A	and we  were just  ,
3072	6	B	uh-huh .
3072	7	A	finally had  to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.
3072	5	A	but it was,
3072	20	B	what did you wind up with? .
3072	4	A	oh, i had fondue.
3072	4	A	that was easy to say .
3072	14	B	oh, okay .
3072	4	A	tried to get fondue and white wine,
3072	5	A	and that was,
3072	6	B	uh, uh-huh.
3072	4	A	we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly.
3072	4	A	there were some people at the next table who spoke english,
3072	4	A	so we ,
3072	29	B	they kind of guided you.
3072	7	A	elicited their aid for a while
3072	4	A	and,
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	7	A	they were very helpful
3072	4	A	so,
3072	9	B	well, good.
3072	7	A	it was, it was a pleasant time.
3072	4	A	i'd, i'd love to go back there.
3072	4	A	there's just not time .
3072	2	A	there's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.
3072	2	B	i guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.
3072	6	A	right.
3072	5	A	that's ,
3072	6	B	yeah.
3072	2	B	i guess that's what retirement is all about.
3072	16	A	<Laughter>.
3072	16	B	<Laughter>.
3072	2	A	that and sleeping late .
3072	6	B	yes.
3072	4	A	i keep hoping for.
3072	6	B	uh-huh.
3072	12	A	well
3072	4	B	i understand that.
3072	7	A	it was nice talking with you.
3072	12	B	well, it was nice talking with you too, craig.
3072	12	A	and have a good afternoon.
3072	12	B	you do the same.
3072	12	A	okay.
3072	38	B	thank you.
3072	12	A	good-bye.
3072	12	B	bye-bye.
3096	20	A	well, uh, ho-, how do you view this whole subject?
3096	16	B	<Laughter>.
3096	13	A	are you, uh, one who feels like you have, have benefited from the change in, in roles in women?
3096	1	A	or, or what do you think?
3096	19	B	oh, yeah
3096	5	B	i,
3096	19	B	yeah,
3096	2	B	i think so.
3096	14	A	uh-huh.
3096	6	B	yeah,
3096	2	B	there's been a lot of changes.
3096	2	B	i think there's still a lot to be made, though.
3096	3	A	yes,
3096	3	A	oh, yes,
3096	2	A	i think so.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	13	A	are you, uh, are you someone who works outside your home,
3096	15	A	or have you,
3096	19	B	yeah,
3096	19	B	yeah
3096	4	B	i work for t i.
3096	6	A	oh, yes,
3096	14	B	uh-huh.
3096	13	A	well, uh, have there been significant changes, uh, do you think in the employment place, ex-, especially, uh, say at t i.
3096	19	B	uh-huh.
3096	13	A	have, has anything in particular changed that you have noticed?
3096	5	B	uh,
3096	7	A	during your time there.
3096	2	B	uh, i guess there's more women in, uh, what would be classified as a man's job .
3096	14	A	yeah,
3096	14	A	uh-huh.
3096	20	A	what, what kind of work do you do?
3096	4	B	i am a drafter.
3096	14	A	uh-huh.
3096	4	B	i am in a man's job .
3096	3	A	right.
3096	4	B	but we have got more women in it now.
3096	3	A	yes,
3096	3	A	yes.
3096	4	B	there's a lot of us in it.
3096	6	A	yes, uh,
3096	5	B	so.
3096	6	A	yes
3096	2	A	in years past, i know, in fact, even, even the word drafter has changed,
3096	5	B	uh.
3096	4	A	because, it used to be they were draftsman .
3096	3	B	uh-huh,
3096	4	B	we have some engineers that still, on their, uh,
3096	4	B	the drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman.
3096	6	A	right.
3096	4	B	and i want to scratch it out and put drafter .
3096	4	B	but i thought, well i am,
3096	24	A	# maybe not, huh. #
3096	7	B	# not going to do that # .
3096	4	A	well, uh, i, when i was in college,
3096	4	A	i graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty-four.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	and i was a math major, which was a real rarity,
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	7	A	among women at that time.
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	4	A	so, i was in a lot of classes where, uh, there, i was either the only girl or, you know, one of just a very,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	few women in the class.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	2	A	so, that was a change
3096	4	A	and, uh, even, uh , i did not, uh, use my math, uh, in my work,
3096	4	A	i, i became a technical writer.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	but, uh, even so, there were very, very few women in technical writing.
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	2	A	but, that has changed a lot.
3096	6	B	oh, yeah.
3096	2	A	in recent years it has just really, really changed a lot.
3096	6	B	uh-huh,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	and, and i think that, uh, you know, the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management,
3096	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3096	2	A	but i think they have got a long way to go .
3096	3	B	oh, definitely,
3096	3	B	definitely.
3096	4	A	there was something on t v the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the  heads of, uh, chairmen of the board,  chair-, chair persons, uh, if you sa-, if you will,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	of the board  are women in this country.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	2	A	and i thought that, you know, that's pretty si-, a pretty significantly small number.
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	2	A	so, there are some, some strides to be made there.
3096	6	B	yeah,
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	28	A	but, uh, i do not know,
3096	2	A	i, i think we have come a long way,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	actually,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	when i think about, you know, when things were like even, when i, you know, just when i was in high school,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	and how it is now for girls.
3096	6	B	yeah,
3096	4	A	and, uh,
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	5	B	do you,
3096	7	A	uh, i guess  my, i, uh, the one,  my one bad thing is that i am, that i wish my mother had had some of those opportunities, because, i think she would have really, she rea-, would have succeeded in a lot of ways,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	that men, that women were not able to succeed,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	in her,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	generation.
3096	3	B	exactly.
3096	13	A	so, anyway. do you have children?
3096	26	B	no,
3096	26	B	huh-uh.
3096	4	A	i was going to say do you have daughters.
3096	2	A	that's always a good question.
3096	13	B	do you?
3096	19	A	yes.
3096	4	A	in fact, i have a daughter who is in a, a, who just graduated in civil engineering, from college.
3096	9	B	oh, wonderful.
3096	4	A	so,  she is pretty much,  although there were some other women in her class,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	she was,  you know, uh, one of the minorities,
3096	6	B	uh-huh,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	uh, females in the class.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	so, she definitely entering into, uh, a male profession.
3096	3	B	oh, yeah.
3096	4	A	but,  uh,
3096	3	B	yeah.
3096	7	A	but,  you know, for instance there are, there is the organization women, the society of women engineers,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	2	A	so, that is recognized,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	as, uh, you know, a place where women should be.
3096	6	B	uh-huh,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	28	A	but, uh, i do not know,
3096	2	A	i, you see it in, uh, also in, uh, like in church, uh, where more and more women are becoming ministers.
3096	6	B	oh, yeah.
3096	7	A	in, uh, you know, in protestant congregations
3096	2	A	and, uh, it will be interesting to see if, if roman catholicism ever, uh, recognizes women  in,
3096	16	B	<Laughter>.
3096	7	A	in  the role of priest.
3096	13	A	i do-, i do not know if you are roman catholic or,
3096	26	B	no,
3096	26	B	huh-uh.
3096	7	A	you know, what you know about that.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	i am not either,
3096	2	A	but, uh, that is one area where it, that i can see might change, but i really doubt will change .
3096	6	B	yeah,
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	16	A	</Laughter>.
3096	2	B	not for a long time anyway.
3096	3	A	no,
3096	3	A	probably not.
3096	3	A	huh-uh.
3096	16	B	<Laughter>.
3096	20	A	so, uh, uh, how about, what in particular would you think that, uh, women still, other than the work place, where women still are being, uh, oh, you know, found wanting, you know, or not re-, as highly regarded as men would be. uh,
3096	4	A	i was just trying to think.
3096	4	A	oh, i know something.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	5	A	maybe you could te-,
3096	11	A	what do you think that, what do you think, tell me what you think about this.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	the, uh, the, uh, the role of women in combat roles during the war?
3096	6	B	oh, oh.
3096	4	A	because, i know that there, now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles.
3096	6	B	uh-huh,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	2	A	and the only, uh, branch in the armed fo-, services that seems willing to do that is the air force.
3096	4	A	and,
3096	5	B	huh.
3096	7	A	uh, i spoke because women were filing, flying missions into, you know, for whatever reason, into, uh, in the persian gulf war.
3096	6	B	yeah,
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	4	A	and so. but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job.
3096	16	B	<Noise>.
3096	2	A	it was real interesting,
3096	4	A	they were. i was listening to some of the comments on ra-, television the other day,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	uh, about it,
3096	4	A	and, uh, one of, one of the men who was a,
3096	4	A	i do not know if he was a general or, you know, what his rank was, very high.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	he said, it's just a personal thing with me.
3096	33	A	i mean, i can not be real, you know i can not tell you why i feel this way,
3096	33	A	but i just would rather have, uh, a man doing some of these jobs than a woman.
3096	4	A	i thought, well, at least he was honest .
3096	2	A	but, that does not sit very well with a lot of folks, i am sure .
3096	2	B	there's some men out there that are more feminine than most women .
3096	3	A	yeah,
3096	3	A	right .
3096	2	A	you know, neil, well neil as far as i am concerned, and i could be wrong about this, but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength,
3096	6	B	yeah,
3096	6	B	yeah,
3096	7	A	to do something.
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	4	A	uh, because, i would think, i think, you know, mentally, uh, and emotionally, i think women can handle a job and,
3096	3	B	oh, i do too.
3096	7	A	every bit as well.
3096	5	A	so
3096	6	B	uh-huh,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	anyway it's still # , #
3096	2	B	# and, you know, # if she wanted to go to combat,
3096	6	A	sure.
3096	7	B	i do not see that they should stop her.
3096	4	B	i personally would not want to go
3096	5	B	but ,
3096	3	A	no,
3096	4	A	i would not either.
3096	3	A	no,
3096	4	A	i agree
3096	4	A	but i am sure that there are women who would, would relish that,
3096	6	B	oh, yeah,
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	7	A	you know, kind of job.
3096	4	A	so,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	uh, i guess that should be taken into consideration,
3096	6	B	uh-huh,
3096	7	A	as well.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	2	A	so, well, this is an interesting topic,
3096	16	B	<Noise>.
3096	4	A	um, i have, you know, i have,
3096	4	A	having a daughter who has gone into this, into engineering,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	i sort of watched progress to see if she did anything differently than i did .
3096	6	B	uh-huh .
3096	4	A	she's a lot more forthright about her opinions and,
3096	9	B	good.
3096	7	A	a little more assertive, than i think i was .
3096	2	A	so, that's, that's progress, i guess .
3096	6	B	yeah .
3096	12	A	well, i have enjoyed talking with you lisa,
3096	13	A	and,
3096	12	B	well, same here.
3096	7	A	uh, have you talked with a lot of people in this project
3096	5	A	or,
3096	4	B	well, i am not a home, at home a lot.
3096	6	A	yeah.
3096	4	B	i am at work right now.
3096	6	A	oh, yeah.
3096	4	B	i put my work number,
3096	4	B	but, at home, uh, the recorder gets my calls.
3096	6	A	oh, yeah.
3096	4	B	usually, i am not there,
3096	6	A	right,
3096	4	B	but i probably talked to seven or eight people.
3096	14	A	yeah,
3096	9	A	well,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	that's great,
3096	9	A	that's good.
3096	4	B	i personally have not made any calls yet, myself,
3096	4	B	i,
3096	6	A	yeah.
3096	7	B	just,  it never crosses my  mind.
3096	6	A	yeah.
3096	5	A	well,
3096	4	B	but i enjoy receiving them.
3096	6	A	yeah,
3096	9	A	well,
3096	6	B	uh-huh,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	that's good,
3096	9	A	that's good,
3096	4	A	because, uh,  i,
3096	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3096	7	A	i  guess i placed all but one or two of my calls.
3096	6	B	uh-huh,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	7	A	and, uh, only because i going to make some money,
3096	4	A	see we, our choir is doing this as a money ma-, raising project.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	we, we got the connection through a t i, uh, church member.
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	and, uh, uh, so we are doing it to raise money for, uh, a large project at church,
3096	6	B	uh-huh.
3096	4	A	and, uh, so i feel like this is one way i can contribute that's
3096	6	B	yeah.
3096	7	A	not too painful .
3096	9	B	that's wonderful.
3096	7	A	financially painful, anyway.
3096	16	B	<Laughter>.
3096	2	A	it's just real nice that way
3096	4	A	so, uh, i thought, well i will just get on the stick and do it.
3096	6	B	yeah,
3096	9	B	that's great.
3096	12	A	well, i will say good-bye to you,
3096	12	B	okay.
3096	12	A	but i have enjoyed the conversation.
3096	12	B	well, thanks for calling.
3096	38	A	thank you.
3096	40	B	uh-huh.
3096	12	A	bye-bye.
3096	12	B	bye-bye.
3148	0	A	okay.  um,
3148	20	B	where do you live?
3148	4	A	in plano.
3148	13	B	in plano?
3148	19	A	yes.
3148	20	A	where do you live?
3148	4	B	in dallas.
3148	14	A	oh, okay .
3148	4	B	uh, the air pollution isn't too bad in our area.
3148	4	B	so, we're very fortunate
3148	6	A	huh .
3148	7	B	but i know in some areas,  it's really, it, it really is bad.
3148	4	A	um, i was trying to think, uh,
3148	4	A	something we were watching the other day
3148	4	A	and they were doing an overview of los angeles, uh, from an area that was up higher
3148	4	A	and you literally could see the band of smog.
3148	5	A	that, uh,
3148	4	A	i've never been out there,
3148	4	A	but,
3148	4	B	i haven't either.
3148	7	A	it was, it was quite evident that,
3148	6	B	uh-huh.
3148	7	A	it was a real brown area
3148	5	A	and,
3148	2	B	well, i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that
3148	2	B	and, unfortunately, i think there are a lot of areas that are, that, that bad.
3148	6	A	yeah.
3148	2	B	particularly in the areas where there are industries, uh, where they are burning a lot of coal,
3148	6	A	# yes. #
3148	7	B	# and oil #
3148	6	A	yeah .
3148	7	B	up, more up north, i guess, uh,
3148	2	B	i think it's a bigger problem. with the car pollution, anti-pollution devices,
3148	2	B	i think, uh, air isn't as bad it once was, from the cars, because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area.
3148	6	A	yes.
3148	4	A	well, i know, uh, that's been the concern in europe.
3148	5	A	they hadn't,
3148	4	A	uh, we have friends in germany and, uh, have family that live near the black forest area
3148	4	A	and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we, s-, uh, switched to the unleaded gas and, and had the emission control advice, uh, , devices required on the cars, uh,
3148	4	A	that's something that europe didn't do right away
3148	4	A	and now they're doing that
3148	4	A	and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country, that's the only pollution that's been there.
3148	4	A	it's not an area that is industry
3148	4	A	but they were losing a lot of, uh, trees # and a lot of, #
3148	13	B	# from # acid rain?
3148	23	A	um, i guess. from, from something that the car was, uh, # was giving, #
3148	4	B	# i think # it gives off, uh, in the emissions, it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere, uh, and form a, a weak acid.
3148	6	A	# yes,
3148	5	A	and, #
3148	4	B	# it # just makes the rain fall on the acid side
3148	4	B	and after a period of time, i think that accumulates in, uh, trees because they take it up through their roots, as well as it landing on the leaves, on surfaces,
3148	4	B	like you've seen what it's done to buildings even
3148	6	A	yes.
3148	7	B	where it's really bad.
3148	6	A	yeah.
3148	4	B	what's interesting, several years ago, i took a course, uh, on, uh, well,
3148	4	B	it was actually, it was put on by the power companies and, about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was,
3148	4	B	and there wasn't from various kinds of, of energy.
3148	4	B	and, uh, at that point in time, one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain
3148	4	B	and it was kind of pooh-poohed, you know.
3148	4	B	oh, you're making a mountain out of a molehill, kind of thing.
3148	4	B	and it's turned out that, that's been very true, what he was forecasting about the accumulation of, of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage.
3148	4	B	so, it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course.
3148	4	B	now, a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear.
3148	4	B	uh, i'm not afraid of nuclear, having had that course because of how the nuclear that, uh, they use is not bomb quality,
3148	4	B	and, we're so strict with all our controls in the united states. the chances of, of an accident are slight,
3148	4	B	and, it doesn't pollute the air at all.
3148	4	B	it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant.
3148	4	B	many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants.
3148	4	B	it's kind of funny because people are just petrified, at least some are, at the thought of nuclear.
3148	6	A	yes.
3148	28	B	so, i don't know.
3148	4	B	in europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power
3148	4	B	and they recycle the fuel
3148	5	B	and then instead of, of,
3148	4	B	some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become, uh, bomb quality.
3148	2	B	but, that's the only sensible thing to do, is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground. as far as i'm concerned, where it could eventually, perhaps, there's some problem, uh, pollute the groundwater.
3148	28	B	so, i don't know what the answer is.
3148	2	B	the best answer, of course, would be solar or, uh, fusion, or something clean .
3148	6	A	yes.
3148	13	B	well, we've got a problem on the line, don't we.
3148	19	A	yeah.
3148	4	A	i, i get that sometimes, um,
3148	4	A	my line gets some static.
3148	4	A	i don't # know why. #
3148	6	B	# uh-huh. #
3148	2	B	but, uh, solar, of course, would be the clean, the cleanest.
3148	5	A	well, i know it's , um,
3148	16	B	<Static>.
3148	4	A	we did have a solar water heater when we lived in houston
3148	2	A	and, uh, oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal.
3148	4	B	i can't hear you at all for all # this static. #
3148	4	A	# oh. # i don't know what to,
3148	4	A	usually it's the other phone i have trouble with.
3148	4	A	it must just,
3148	16	B	</Static>.
3148	7	A	be on the line.
3148	13	A	can you hear me?
3148	4	B	now i can again.
3148	6	A	okay.
3148	16	B	<Static>.
3148	4	A	i don't know what, uh,  i, i don't know what  the problem is
3148	4	A	but, uh, when we lived in houston we had a solar water heater
3148	4	A	# and #
3148	6	B	# uh-huh. #
3148	7	A	we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy
3148	4	A	and we have enough clouds that, uh, there are other areas that would be better suited.
3148	4	A	that surprised me because i think,
3148	7	B	</Static>.
3148	7	A	we have a tremendous amount of, um, sunny days.
3148	6	B	uh-huh.
3148	5	A	and, and it,
3148	6	A	yes,
3148	4	A	it can be used
3148	4	A	and it can help
3148	4	A	but, uh, that was a problem that they were still working on.
3148	5	A	but,
3148	6	B	oh yeah.
3148	2	B	it, it's still got a long way to go.
3148	5	A	# well i, #
3148	2	B	# it's just, # you know, a possible solution
3148	6	A	yes.
3148	7	B	in the future, i think, maybe to help in some ways.
3148	4	B	it may not in all ways.
3148	4	B	maybe they'll come up with fusion. you know, con-, be able to control it.
3148	4	B	i don't know how long that'll take,
3148	2	B	but, one of these days,
3148	2	B	because that's perfectly clean.
3148	6	A	yes.
3148	4	B	it's just we can't control it.
3148	4	B	right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out,
3148	5	B	so, it isn't, not at all,
3148	4	B	and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field,
3148	4	B	so that's not going to work. at least not now.
3148	2	B	but, uh, who knows what the future will hold. uh, as far as energy goes,
3148	2	B	i, i think, with solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well.
3148	9	A	uh, i hope so .
3148	4	B	i do to.
3148	4	B	i like to be optimistic,
3148	4	B	i don't like to be pessimistic about these things.
3148	5	A	well, i do think, um,
3148	2	A	i mean, you've already mentioned several things, i think, uh, just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in, uh,
3148	2	B	we have one earth,
3148	6	A	yes .
3148	7	B	to live on
3148	2	B	and we got to take care of it.
3148	6	A	yes.
3148	2	A	# well, #
3148	6	B	# uh-huh. #
3148	7	A	and, and for the future generations, too. uh,
3148	4	B	i've noticed students are, are much more, you know, young, young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment
3148	6	A	# yes. #
3148	7	B	# and # protecting the earth.
3148	2	B	and so, if we can raise it, uh, you know, generations with those concerns, we'll solve a lot of our problems.
3148	5	B	i'm afraid,
3148	4	B	i know i was part of the me generation where they didn't, so many of them didn't, people didn't care.
3148	5	B	you know,
3148	5	B	it's whatever, you know,
3148	33	B	recycle, well, if it's a problem, forget that.
3148	33	B	uh, not throw the trash out the car window
3148	33	B	and leave it in the car and then throw it away?
3148	2	B	how horrible, you know.
3148	16	A	<Laughter>.
3148	4	B	now, i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes,
3148	5	B	and  ...
3156	2	A	ing seems to be a, a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to, uh, catch on, it seems, or maybe a generation to two .
3156	2	A	and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up.
3156	2	A	uh, it does seem to be a lot of habits to break.
3156	4	A	i, uh, wasn't raised as a kid on it,
3156	4	A	but my kids are
3156	4	A	and so they, they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do,
3156	4	A	and we were doing all right there until, uh, the price dropped out
3156	4	A	and they weren't worth anything anymore.
3156	6	B	uh-huh.
3156	5	A	and we ,
3156	4	A	it took us, almost a year to get a garbage sack full.
3156	4	A	we just don't drink that many.
3156	4	A	so as far as at home use, uh, we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something
3156	4	A	and, and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in, uh,
3156	4	A	at the time it was still, oh, about forty or fifty cents a pound,
3156	4	A	and we came out with about a dollar ,
3156	2	A	it just really wasn't worth it.
3156	29	B	and a lot of hassle all year round
3156	29	B	and cans laying,
3156	3	A	yeah.
3156	30	B	yeah.
3156	4	A	so, they, they realized, you know,
3156	4	A	well, of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old.
3156	4	A	that wasn't, uh, that was a big deal,
3156	4	A	but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it
3156	4	A	and then, uh, t i started keeping up with, uh, cans there,
3156	4	A	so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there.
3156	4	A	least it gets back into the system,
3156	4	A	but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up.
3156	13	A	have you all got the individual containers yet?
3156	26	B	no,
3156	4	B	i read in the paper this week where maybe,
3156	28	B	i don't know if it w-, was,
3156	4	B	i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time.
3156	5	A	um.
3156	4	B	but, it, it should be starting, i would stay probably in the next month if, if everything goes that ,
3156	4	B	i'm not sure all what we're going to have to do, whether we have three separate containers,
3156	4	B	i really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything.
3156	6	A	right.
3156	6	A	yeah,
3156	2	A	it seemed like, uh,
3156	4	A	if, if i recall, it's been a long time.
3156	2	A	they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it.
3156	2	A	they were fine on the green, big green containers
3156	6	B	uh-huh.
3156	2	A	but, uh, seems like they said they were just going to have a bin
3156	4	A	and all different types would go in there
3156	4	A	and then that they would sort it  as --
3156	6	B	oh.
3156	7	A	as  needed.
3156	2	A	it, it seemed that there was,
3156	4	A	at the time anyway, it, the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at, at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it, happen to do it pretty well, uh, those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting.
3156	4	A	but when it comes down to just general purpose trash, that all the houses, uh,
3156	4	A	the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor,
3156	4	A	so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than, than
3156	6	B	uh-huh.
3156	7	A	having a household try it.
3156	28	A	but i, i don't know,
3156	2	A	that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house.
3156	2	B	well, it would get messy, too.
3156	6	A	yeah,
3156	6	A	yeah,
3156	4	B	i, i, i know other places when they recycle, they have to, like, wash out their glass jars and
3156	6	A	right.
3156	7	B	whatnot. and, uh, which we're not in the habit of doing.
3156	3	A	that's true.
3156	4	B	i was brought up, uh, you know, long time ago, that they didn't even have cans.
3156	4	B	they had bottles
3156	4	B	and you'd return them to the
3156	6	A	right.
3156	7	B	the grocery store
3156	4	B	and you'd get our money back
3156	2	B	and that, that was all well and good.
3156	4	B	they don't seem to still be doing that.
3156	2	B	if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass,
3156	4	B	but, i guess this day and age
3156	6	A	yeah.
3156	7	B	they don't.
3156	24	A	they don't do that.
3156	4	A	we live next to a set of railroad tracks
3156	2	A	and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to  crash,  you know
3156	6	B	uh-huh.
3156	7	A	break  them,
3156	4	A	but, uh, they weren't that successful,
3156	4	A	so there were a lot of bottles to be returned
3156	4	A	and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted
3156	6	B	uh-huh.
3156	7	A	for the day
3156	5	A	and,
3156	6	B	yeah,
3156	5	B	and they, uh, p-,
3156	2	B	i, i think kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,
3156	2	B	they can get more somewhere else.
3156	6	A	yeah,
3156	2	A	just a little bit of begging will ,
3156	5	B	uh, for a good,
3156	6	B	right.
3156	5	B	they're,
3156	2	B	the nickels, the dimes or what, i suppose it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get, they, the kids just don't seem to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money.
3156	6	A	right.
3156	5	A	well, i wonder,
3156	4	B	but, we, we did buy a can crusher
3156	4	B	and we are crushing cans
3156	4	B	and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents,
3156	2	B	so i would say
3156	6	A	yeah.
3156	7	B	in the last three years, we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before.
3156	2	B	uh, it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat.
3156	6	A	right,
3156	6	A	yeah.
3156	4	B	so that's the main reason we're, we, sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles .
3156	20	A	where do you take your cans?
3156	21	B	well, as you say, it takes a while to build it up.
3156	4	B	since we've had the crusher all summer, we , i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta-, oh,
3156	4	B	i think the kids, when we were on vacation, they said they did take them to a, a recycling place, probably at one of the li-,
3181	0	A	okay.
3181	6	B	all right,
3181	4	B	well, i'm not a big exerciser,
3181	4	B	but i kind of had to start after i had my baby because i wanted to lose that extra weight.
3181	6	A	uh-huh.
3181	4	B	and so basically at this point i'm, i'm a real walker.
3181	4	A	i am, too.
3181	18	B	are you?
3181	19	A	yes.
3181	4	B	i don't do that, oh, i guess i'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, you know, and
3181	6	A	uh-huh.
3181	7	B	keep their arms up.
3181	4	B	i don't do that.
3181	4	B	i mostly just take a, a walk around the block or with my baby
3181	4	B	or, you know, and i have to do that at least once a day.  if it,
3181	9	A	oh, that's good.
3181	7	B	if it's  going to make any effect on, since i have to eat the same as i did before.
3181	4	B	i can't neglect that because of the baby either.
3181	20	A	and how old is your baby?
3181	4	B	she just, uh, well, she was premature,
3181	4	B	so she's about nine months now, though.
3181	2	B	goll-, times goes fast.
3181	3	A	yes.
3181	16	B	<Laughter>.
3181	4	A	well, i walk two and a half to three miles every night.
3181	9	B	oh, that's great.
3181	4	A	my husband and i were on nutrisystem about eighteen months ago
3181	6	B	uh-huh.
3181	4	A	and he lost sixty-two pounds
3181	16	B	<Breathing>.
3181	4	A	and i lost twenty-one.
3181	9	B	oh, my goodness.
3181	4	A	so we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program
3181	4	A	and we walk our dog every night
3181	6	B	uh-huh.
3181	7	A	and go up around the elementary school.
3181	4	A	we have a little path that we do.
3181	6	B	uh-huh.
3181	7	A	and, uh, except if it's raining or real cold
3181	6	B	yeah.
3181	7	A	which it hasn't been
3181	6	B	exactly.
3181	4	A	we try to get out, uh, every, every night.
3181	6	B	uh-huh.
3181	4	A	and he plays racquetball twice a week,
3181	4	A	but i'm not into that,
3181	2	A	so
3181	16	B	<Laughter>.
3181	7	A	i think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned.
3181	2	B	well, i think that is just wonderful.
3181	4	B	now, as far as i'm concerned, i have several other children
3181	2	B	and so, uh, i think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task.
3181	3	A	yes.
3181	4	B	you know. uh, it's not to where i'm just so freed up that i, i just go, oh, this is wonderful,
3181	33	B	let's go .
3181	3	A	right ,
3181	3	A	that's right.
3181	4	A	i know my kids are into sports
3181	4	A	and a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty
3181	4	A	so we will just go out after that.
3181	6	B	uh-huh.
3181	4	A	so, my kids, luckily, are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk.
3181	6	B	yeah.
3181	13	B	now, does your husband usually go with you, then?
3181	19	A	yes.
3181	9	B	oh, see, now that's really nice.
3181	3	A	yes.
3181	4	B	because mine's at meetings sometimes
3181	4	B	and, and he's not really into it
3181	5	B	so
3181	5	A	no
3181	7	B	i have to,
3181	4	A	my husband never was either until he lost the weight.
3181	6	B	uh-huh.
3181	4	A	that was his decision.
3181	4	A	he had arthritis in his hips
3181	4	A	and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise.
3181	2	B	i think that is so wonderful.
3181	4	A	so once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night.
3181	4	A	and our dog has lost a little weight.
3181	4	A	he walks every night, too .
3181	16	B	<Laughter>.
3181	4	A	so, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking shoes.
3181	9	B	i bet.
3181	2	B	i think that's really, really good.
3181	2	B	and, and, you know, i think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine.
3181	3	A	yes.
3181	5	B	it's not,
3181	4	B	like when i first started, it, you know, that was the hardest thing was
3181	24	A	making time for it.
3181	7	B	to get ready and get out there.
3181	4	B	but now if i haven't done it in a day or two or something, i really notice that i haven't done it in a ...
3181	6	A	yes.
3181	4	B	you know. and i like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me
3181	4	B	and sometimes they don't.
3181	4	B	and when they don't, i, i really notice, you know, how fun it can be when they come.
3181	4	B	so, uh, i like to have somebody come with me.
3181	3	A	i know,
3181	4	A	i do, too.
3181	4	B	uh, i know most of, enough of the people that if anything ever happened i could go to a home
3181	6	A	right.
3181	7	B	around this block area.
3181	4	B	so it, it's not real dangerous,
3181	4	B	but still, i don't like to go alone.
3181	3	A	no.
3181	5	B	so .
3181	4	A	i never do either. even if i have my dog with me.
3181	6	B	yeah.
3181	3	A	you know, it's nice to have another person there,
3181	5	A	but ...
3181	3	B	yeah.
3181	5	B	you know,
3181	4	A	mostly, it's my husband
3181	4	A	and sometimes it's my kids.
3181	2	B	well, i think that's great.
3181	4	B	i, and, well, sometimes when  i, i  take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise i, i really think i do.
3181	4	B	i was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing.
3181	6	A	uh-huh.
3181	4	B	uh, i found real quick that wasn't for me.
3181	4	A	me, too.
3181	4	A	i did the dance step when i lived up in
3181	6	B	uh-huh .
3181	7	A	michigan
3181	4	A	and it just wore me out.
3181	4	A	i would leave totally exhausted.
3181	4	A	i never lost any weight,
3181	4	A	and i got to the point i dreaded going in.
3181	6	B	yeah,
3181	6	B	yeah.
3181	4	A	so walking seems to be a good solution for me
3181	4	A	and it doesn't cost anything .
3181	3	B	right ,
3181	3	B	right.
3181	4	B	and it gives me time to think.
3181	4	B	so i think, not only does it help my body,
3181	4	B	but i think it helps my mind
3181	3	A	yes.
3181	7	B	too.
3181	4	B	so i like that.
3181	4	A	that's the one time in the day my husband and i can get away and talk
3181	6	B	uh-huh.
3181	7	A	without having the kids jump in and ...
3181	3	B	yeah,
3181	24	B	need something
3181	5	B	and,
3181	3	A	yep.
3181	2	B	they can wait until you get back home.
3181	3	A	yep.
3181	2	B	well, i think that's great .
3181	4	B	well, that's what i do for ,
3181	6	A	yep,
3181	4	A	that's all i do, too.
3181	6	B	okay.
3181	30	A	okay.
3184	11	A	well, basically, uh, did you want to go first, then?
3184	3	B	uh, well, i can.
3184	4	B	i, i don't own my home.
3184	6	A	okay,
3184	6	A	right.
3184	4	B	uh, i mean i, i live in a nice area
3184	4	B	and i rent my home
3184	4	B	and
3184	6	A	uh-huh.
3184	7	B	uh, we aren't sure we're going to buy a house yet because we don't know if we're going to be staying here.
3184	6	A	sure,
3184	6	A	uh-huh.
3184	7	B	in, uh, texas,
3184	5	B	so,
3184	6	A	yeah.
3184	4	A	i think as far as, like, our home, it's, uh, in a small residential area.
3184	4	A	we're out of the cities quite a ways,
3184	4	A	so it's kind of more of a country setting
3184	4	A	and, uh, it's just a typical, uh, three bedroom type of home.
3184	4	A	it's, it's nothing, you know, elaborate where it has, uh, this or this or, you know.
3184	4	A	it's, it's
3184	6	B	uh-huh.
3184	7	A	just a typical home with, uh, three bedrooms, uh, two story type home.
3184	4	A	uh, and i think as far as if it's, for put it into standards of, uh, what other homes are around here, it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are.
3184	4	A	uh, there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes
3184	5	A	and yet there's,
3184	4	A	where we can view the river from that distance, there's still homes within our area that are, you know, pretty typical of what our home is,
3184	4	A	so
3184	6	B	uh-huh
3184	7	A	it's, uh, pretty much that, uh, type of, uh, home
3184	5	A	so,
3184	6	B	yeah.
3184	4	B	well,  our ho-,
3184	5	A	uh,
3184	7	B	our house,  we, we're renting it from an individual who bought it
3184	4	B	and he lives in korea.
3184	7	A	uh-huh,
3184	18	A	oh, really?
3184	4	B	and, uh, he's recently moved here
3184	4	B	and he's owns eight or nine properties
3184	6	A	sure.
3184	7	B	uh, near here
3184	6	A	uh-huh.
3184	5	B	and, uh, so,
3184	6	A	yeah.
3184	4	B	but the houses around here, there's five, five houses on my street for sale right now.
3184	6	A	oh, yeah,
3184	6	A	yeah.
3184	7	B	which is just, uh, in trouble
3184	6	A	yeah.
3184	7	B	to me.
3184	4	B	and they're not very expensive either.
3184	4	B	it just seems like,
3184	4	B	we have a three bedroom house.
3184	4	B	ours is one level only.
3184	6	A	uh-huh.
3184	5	B	uh, but we,
3184	13	A	so it's the rambler style.
3184	19	B	yeah,
3184	4	B	we have two, two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen
3184	0	B	and,
3184	6	A	uh-huh.
3184	7	B	the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger.
3184	6	A	yeah,
3184	6	A	yeah.
3184	5	B	so,
3184	4	A	it's kind of like what ours is.
3184	4	A	uh, one of our bedrooms is really small
3184	4	A	and we've made that into a den because we only have one child,
3184	4	A	so that was our best way of going with, uh, the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller.
3184	2	A	it seems like they get incredibly small .
3184	6	B	yeah.
3184	5	A	uh, but, uh, anyway, but, okay.
3184	2	A	so that sounds great,
3184	4	A	and, uh, i don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever.
3184	13	B	have you d-, have you done this before?
3184	13	A	the t i?
3184	19	B	uh-huh.
3184	19	A	uh, yes,
3184	4	A	uh, about three times before.
3184	18	B	oh, have you?
3184	4	A	i'm fairly new to it,
3184	4	A	but it seems to be going okay.
3184	6	B	yeah.
3184	13	B	are you in texas?
3184	26	A	no,
3184	26	A	huh-uh.
3184	30	B	no,
3184	6	B	yeah,
3184	26	A	no,
3184	4	A	i'm out of state.
3184	4	A	i'm in wisconsin,
3184	5	A	so,
3184	18	B	oh, really?
3184	19	A	yeah,
3184	19	A	yeah.
3184	6	B	oh.
3184	5	A	so it's,
3184	9	B	sounds interesting.
3184	0	A	uh, other than that, sure, yeah.
3184	13	A	is this your first time?
3184	26	B	no,
3184	26	B	huh-uh.
3184	4	B	i've, well, i've gotten several calls.
3184	6	A	uh-huh.
3184	5	B	uh, but, uh,
3184	4	A	i'm always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because it's like i can get it done with .
3184	7	B	yeah.
3184	4	A	i don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though i have a feeling what's going to happen is i'll probably get tons of calls, you know, so, sooner or later.
3184	6	B	yeah,
3184	6	B	yeah,
3184	4	B	well, they've, i've talked to some people from cleveland
3184	4	B	and i did talk to someone
3184	5	A	uh-,
3184	7	B	else who lives here
3184	6	A	uh-huh.
3184	7	B	in the same city i do,
3184	4	B	so
3184	6	A	yeah,
3184	6	A	yeah.
3184	7	B	that was kind of interesting .
3184	6	A	yeah,
3184	6	A	sure.
3184	2	B	they're, they're sure getting their people out,
3184	12	B	so, well
3184	12	A	yeah.
3184	7	B	it was nice to talk to you, anyway
3184	12	B	and,
3184	12	A	okay,
3184	12	A	well, you take it easy, gail.
3184	12	B	okay,
3184	12	B	thanks.
3184	12	A	bye, now.
3184	12	B	bye-bye.
3190	20	A	where have you been on a wonderful vacation?
3190	4	B	well normally when we go on vacation we go home, to colorado.
3190	4	A	oh, that's where we go home, too.
3190	6	B	really.
3190	6	B	yeah,
3190	4	B	colorado springs is where we're from.
3190	4	A	that's where we go.
3190	9	B	how funny.
3190	3	A	yes,
3190	4	A	my husband's family lives just off of academy boulevard at maize land.
3190	18	B	really?
3190	19	A	yes.
3190	4	B	we live up, up, uh, lake, in the broadmoor area
3190	5	A	uh.
3190	4	B	that's where my fam-, my in-laws are.
3190	4	A	oh, we've been there.
3190	4	A	we haven't skied at broadmoor.
3190	4	A	we went there last year at christmas time
3190	4	A	and it was twenty-seven below.
3190	6	B	oh.
3190	4	A	so we had to cancel our ski lessons .
3190	6	B	uh-huh,
3190	4	B	as of you can't even ski there anymore.
3190	18	A	really?
3190	19	B	yeah,
3190	4	B	they closed it down.
3190	13	A	oh, just this year?
3190	19	B	uh-huh
3190	9	A	oh, my,
3190	4	B	they don't have enough money
3190	5	A	uh.
3190	7	B	to keep it going,
3190	4	B	it doesn't, doesn't pay.
3190	5	B	so.
3190	2	A	so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation, now
3190	31	B	well
3190	7	A	if you were a skier.
3190	7	B	you know, well, now i don't know.
3190	2	B	now colorado springs is real accessible to lake breckenridge
3190	6	A	uh-huh.
3190	4	B	it's only a couple of hours away.
3190	2	B	and, uh, so, it's, it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else.
3190	4	B	but, you can't, can't ski up there any more.
3190	6	A	no.
3190	4	B	oh, i'd like to go on vacation.
3190	4	B	i c-, my husband and i want to go to florida
3190	6	A	uh-huh.
3190	7	B	to go to disney world,
3190	4	B	but we have two little ones
3190	6	A	yes.
3190	7	B	that are under two right now,
3190	4	B	so we want to wait until they're a little bit older
3190	6	A	oh.
3190	7	B	to do that,
3190	5	B	and,
3190	4	A	well, we went on a family cruise last year, on the premier family cruise line
3190	4	A	and then we went to disney.
3190	4	A	it was all part of the package.
3190	6	B	oh.
3190	4	A	and on the cruise ship they had mickey and minnie and chip and dale and goofy and donald duck,
3190	4	A	and it was really oriented toward little kids.
3190	9	B	well, how fun.
3190	4	A	so the kids could eat with chip and dale, you know,
3190	2	A	and, you know
3190	6	B	oh yeah,
3190	7	A	it was just a lot of fun.
3190	9	B	oh, i bet.
3190	4	A	so then we were on the cruise for three days in the bahamas,
3190	4	A	and then landed at cape canaveral and then drove over to orlando and spent four days at disney.
3190	9	B	wow,
3190	9	B	well  that sounds pretty,
3190	6	A	yes,
3190	2	A	that was the way to travel.
3190	7	B	yeah, that sounds pretty  good.
3190	3	A	yes.
3190	13	B	and it was all a big package deal
3190	19	A	yes.
3190	7	B	where you just pay one price
3190	23	A	that's right.
3190	7	B	and get everything?
3190	23	A	that's right,
3190	4	A	and kids are really cheaper, too.
3190	6	B	really.
3190	4	A	we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise,
3190	4	A	so they said we could either cancel, reschedule, or take whatever was available.
3190	4	A	so we took whatever was available,
3190	4	A	and we left a day early,
3190	4	A	and they put us up at the cocoa beach hilton,
3190	4	A	and the ship that was available, the only, uh, rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites.
3190	9	B	wow.
3190	4	A	so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin.
3190	9	B	oh
3190	6	A	yeah.
3190	7	B	what a deal.
3190	4	A	so then our cruise was actually extended a day,
3190	4	A	and our disney was extended a day,
3190	4	A	so we turned a seven day trip into ten
3190	9	B	great,
3190	4	A	and they paid for everything.
3190	9	B	well, that's great.
3190	3	A	yes.
3190	6	B	oh.
3190	2	A	so that was a wonderful vacation.
3190	3	B	yeah,
3190	2	B	i bet.
3190	4	B	that sounds like the way i'd want to do it
3190	6	A	yes.
3190	7	B	i think.
3190	1	A	well, what kind of things do you like to do when you go to colorado?
3190	4	B	oh, well, we like to ski, of course,
3190	4	B	so we spend so much time with our families
3190	6	A	yes.
3190	7	B	uh, and seeing our friends,
3190	4	B	because we moved to texas about two years ago. so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do
3190	6	A	yeah.
3190	4	B	so we don't, we don't get a lot of time to just vacation.
3190	4	B	we did, um, last year, though, go to san antonio for memorial day
3190	6	A	oh.
3190	7	B	which was fun just to get to kind of walk around
3190	6	A	uh-huh.
3190	7	B	and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing.
3190	2	B	uh, but, you know, other, other than that, with, with both my kids being under two, it's real hard
3190	6	A	right.
3190	7	B	to do any, any kind of
3190	5	A	that would be,
3190	7	B	events that, uh
3190	6	A	yes.
3190	7	B	don't, don't require as much,
3190	6	A	i know,
3190	4	A	i think one of the places i always hit in colorado, is that current outlet store.
3190	6	B	yeah
3190	2	B	. that's funny -- *needs slash because a asks what was said before b repeats word "funny"
3190	32	A	that's what,
3190	7	B	funny
3190	0	B	you should mention that,
3190	4	B	i just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it.
3190	13	A	oh, with the santa claus on the cover.
3190	19	B	uh-huh.
3190	6	A	yes,
3190	4	A	i've already ordered from that one,
3190	4	A	but we will probably be going up at thanksgiving this year,
3190	5	A	so.
3190	20	B	oh, do you live, where do you,
3190	20	B	what state are you in?
3190	4	A	texas.
3190	4	B	oh, you're in texas.
3190	3	A	yes,
3190	4	A	i'm in the dallas area.
3190	4	B	so am i.
3190	7	A	in plano.
3190	4	B	i'm in garland.
3190	4	A	uh
3190	6	B	yeah.
3190	7	A	so that's not too far.
3190	4	B	i talked to somebody from wisconsin or something the other day.
3190	6	A	oh.
3190	6	B	yeah,
3190	4	B	so i guess they get people from all over.
3190	3	A	yes.
3190	6	B	yeah,
3190	2	B	driving for thanksgiving, that's going to be quite a drive for,
3190	3	A	well it was when we left last year.
3190	4	A	we left on the eighteenth, right before that big snow storm hit colorado
3190	6	B	uh-huh.
3190	4	A	and we pulled in just as it hit.
3190	9	B	wow.
3190	20	A	so, how do you go?
3190	13	A	do you go up through the raton pass, when you go up there?
3190	26	B	uh, no,
3190	5	B	ret-, oh,
3190	21	B	well, wait a minute,
3190	19	B	yeah,
3190	4	B	we do,
3190	4	B	we do.
3190	4	A	that's on like route two eighty-seven or something like that.
3190	6	B	yeah,
3190	6	B	uh-huh,
3190	4	B	and then we go straight up through trinidad
3190	14	A	okay.
3190	7	B	and straight up i twenty-five from there.
3190	14	A	okay,
3190	4	A	we, uh, went a different way when we went last christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little u haul trailer,
3190	4	A	because we had to take our dog in the car, there was no room for luggage.
3190	4	A	so, we went all interstate.
3190	4	A	we went up, um, through oklahoma city
3190	6	B	uh-huh.
3190	7	A	and then up through, uh, kansas, and then turned left and went in on i seventy
3190	6	B	oh.
3190	4	A	and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour.
3190	4	A	it was a little more mile wise
3190	6	B	uh-huh.
3190	4	A	but because you could go sixty-five miles an hour on the,
3191	2	A	now then i think that --
3191	6	B	uh-huh.
3191	13	A	are you there?
3191	19	B	yeah,
3191	4	B	i'm here.
3191	14	A	all right.
3191	13	A	do you have any one that has been in a nursing home?
3191	4	B	uh, well, only my, um, my grandmother, but for a very short time.
3191	4	B	um, she, uh, she was just more or less in a, in a nursing home for, uh, recovery from a broken hip
3191	6	A	oh.
3191	7	B	because she could receive more medical attention.
3191	6	A	yes.
3191	5	B	but, um, that,
3191	4	B	physical therapy was there and whatever,
3191	4	B	but i think, in visiting her there, um, it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in, uh, weren't there mentally.
3191	4	B	uh, she was probably the only person in the, um, whole nursing home that, uh, still had all of her mental facilities about her.
3191	4	B	so that was, uh, that was very disheartening.
3191	20	A	well, what do you think can be done about that?
3191	20	A	i mean, what can we do,
3191	6	B	oh, yeah,
3191	2	B	it's really hard, i guess.
3191	4	B	i, i come from a family of, um, of, uh, take care of your elders, i guess.
3191	4	B	uh, my, my dad's mother is an invalid,
3191	4	B	and she lives with my aunt and uncle,
3191	4	B	and they care for her, you know, all around the clock.
3191	4	B	though she's not, uh, she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention, she, because of arthritis, she's just unable to get out of bed.
3191	4	B	so, i guess, you know, there's that family commitment.
3191	4	B	um, i know that my parents, my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can. um,
3191	5	A	well, i can remembe-,
3191	4	A	of course i'm
3191	6	B	yeah.
3191	7	A	old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this.
3191	6	B	right,
3191	6	B	yeah.
3191	4	A	we did not have to call on, on someone else,
3191	4	A	and i feel,
3191	11	A	no, you tell me how you feel about,
3191	6	B	yeah,
3191	2	B	well probably, i think, as long as the person's able to, um, to understand what's going on around them
3191	4	B	and i think, you know, my grandmother right now is still able to walk around,
3191	4	B	and she's still able to, uh, to do some things for herself, though she gets meals on wheels
3191	6	A	yeah.
3191	7	B	which i think is a great thing, because, um, it saves people from having to prepare food for her, because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on, or whatever, although she does most things very well, it still makes a little bit easier for her.
3191	3	A	certainly d-,
3191	5	B	uh.
3191	4	A	i worked with an agency in west texas that they, it's where they really started this concept of meals on wheels
3191	6	B	uh-huh.
3191	2	A	and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly.
3191	6	B	uh-huh.
3191	2	A	if they didn't have to, you know, go into a kitchen --
3191	6	B	right.
3191	4	A	my mother expired just, just a little over a year ago,
3191	4	A	and we had finally,
3191	4	A	she didn't want to live with either my sister or me
3191	6	B	uh-huh.
3191	4	A	but we, we got, found a retirement center for her,
3191	4	A	and it was beautiful
3191	4	A	and they had all these, they didn't even have nursing care there.
3191	5	A	so until,
3191	4	A	as long as mother was, you know
3191	6	B	uh-huh.
3191	7	A	mobile and
3191	6	B	right.
3191	7	A	got her food,
3191	4	A	and she was with people with whom she enjoyed.
3191	6	B	yeah,
3191	5	B	that,
3191	2	B	i think, you know, it's really funny,
3191	4	B	i have two grandmothers still alive,
3191	4	B	and my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible.
3191	4	B	she's like openly told people.
3191	4	B	she's always been very good about knowing,
3191	4	B	yes, she's eighty-nine,
3191	4	B	and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible, because it's her home.
3191	6	A	sure.
3191	4	B	but when the time comes, um, she, and she can't do things
3191	4	B	and she has to be cared for, whatever, she would prefer, and she's actually said this, to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment, uh, probably with like a living space and a bedroom
3191	9	A	yes, sir.
3191	7	B	with maybe a kitchenette, so that if she, you know, if she wants to fix herself something light, she can do that,
3191	4	B	but if she wants to go to a meal, she can go down the hallway, uh, to a room where there's a cafeteria
3191	6	A	uh-huh.
3191	4	B	and there's other people there,
3191	4	B	and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company.
3191	4	A	being a widow
3191	6	B	uh-huh.
3191	7	A	i find that eating alone is one of the hardest things
3191	6	B	yes.
3191	7	A	i have to do.
3191	6	B	uh-huh.
3191	4	A	i have just recently retired,
3191	4	A	and i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to.
3191	6	B	right.
3191	4	A	so, uh, mother had the little kitchenette
3191	6	B	uh-huh.
3191	4	A	and she could do all these fine things that she just, ha-, had a microwave, had to pop
3191	6	B	right.
3191	7	A	her popcorn.
3191	4	A	now this is wonderful.
3191	6	B	uh-huh.
3191	4	A	but when it came time for a full meal, then mother was able to go with people
3191	6	B	right,
3191	7	A	and, and enjoy.
3191	6	B	yeah,
3191	2	B	i think, i think that probably, until, until they're really invalids, uh, the elderly are invalids, i think that they should be able to interact with other people
3191	3	A	oh, i think so.
3191	7	B	in an environment that they choose, if they can, if the family can afford it.
3191	5	A	well.
3191	4	B	i mean, um, see, i know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house,
3191	4	B	and my parents actually said, you know, that they may have to take their end, sometime, so, because, you know, my grandma, she says who she wants to live with,
3191	4	B	she's pretty, you know,
3191	4	B	she lets people know,
3202	20	A	how would you go about organizing a family reunion?
3202	5	B	well, a-,
3202	5	B	for,
3202	4	B	i grew up in the deep south like south alabama.
3202	5	B	so whenever i think of family reunions,
3202	4	B	my family, like, got together almost every week.
3202	9	A	oh, gee.
3202	4	B	and there would be like thirty people.
3202	4	B	so people talk about, you know, big family reunions
3202	5	B	and i think, like
3202	4	B	i have a friend who just went to, like, wyoming to some big ranch, you know, where like there were four hundred people
3202	9	A	oh, my.
3202	7	B	for their family reunion.
3202	5	B	and i,
3202	4	B	so i mean, how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my relatives.
3202	6	A	uh-huh.
3202	5	B	because i, since i came from,
3202	4	B	my father has, uh, five sisters and two brothers
3202	4	B	and my mother has four brothers and two sisters.
3202	5	B	so i ca-,
3202	4	B	both of my parents had big families,
3202	4	B	and we always wer-, we always got together, just always.
3202	4	B	now it's different because i live here
3202	5	B	and i,
3202	4	B	you know, when i go home i try to see the families, as much of the family as i can
3202	5	B	but
3202	3	A	yes.
3202	7	B	it's real different.
3202	4	B	and i grew up in a real not, i think not normal setting.
3202	29	A	with all of you living so close together.
3202	3	B	right.
3202	4	B	i mean sunday dinner was at my grandmother's
3202	4	B	and, you know, like i said there would be thirty, you know, thirty people,
3202	4	B	and everyone would just bring things
3202	4	B	and
3202	6	A	oh.
3202	7	B	my grandmother would cook and cook and cook.
3202	5	B	and i-,
3202	4	A	well, i come from a very small family.
3202	4	A	and we planned a family reunion this spring. uh, where we are from texas
3202	4	A	and my family is from ohio
3202	4	A	and we met in florida.
3202	6	B	uh-huh.
3202	4	A	so the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to disney together.
3202	4	A	so that's all the family,
3202	4	A	so planning our family reunio-, reunion was very easy , you know .
3202	6	B	yeah,
3202	17	B	i guess so.
3202	9	B	it really sounds like it was fun.
3202	3	A	yeah,
3202	4	A	well, we had a wonderful tim-,
3207	0	A	um, i don't,
3207	4	A	i am only twenty-eight
3207	4	A	and i haven't had much experience with nursing homes.
3207	4	A	i don't, i have never visited any of them
3207	4	A	and, uh, i don't think i've ever even been in one.
3207	13	A	have you?
3207	23	B	um, actually i have, um, i've, i've been in them but, um, just visiting
3207	4	B	and, uh, we used to g-, when we were like in, in our teen ages
3207	4	B	we'd go on sundays and visit, you know, the older people.
3207	4	B	but, um, i have an elderly grandma that lives with us.
3207	6	A	uh-huh.
3207	4	B	and she's lived with us for like five years.
3207	4	B	so i kind of know how it is to, how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home
3207	4	B	or, um, like we, i mean we've had those discussions, you know, about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile
3207	5	B	and ,
3207	2	A	and it, it takes a lot of care
3207	4	A	like twenty-four hours a day someone,
3207	6	B	yeah.
3207	7	A	has to be,
3207	5	B	it's rea-,
3207	7	A	well, there's someone in my, my fiancee's family.
3207	4	A	his grandmother too and they're, that hi-, her son, his uncle, whatever, you know, anyway.
3207	16	B	<Laughter>.
3207	4	A	he, he has, he's recently retired
3207	4	A	and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke
3207	4	A	and, and all the other children are working or whatever.
3207	6	B	uh-huh.
3207	4	A	they're all my parents age.
3207	4	A	and, uh, so he's got, you know, his retirement though is really twenty-four hours a day.
3207	4	A	they have a day care two days a week.
3207	4	A	they call it senior citizen day care.
3207	4	A	but she goes in the senior citizen center.
3207	18	B	oh, really?
3207	4	A	so sh-, he gets a break two days a week
3207	4	A	but it's only for like two or three hours at a time.
3207	6	B	uh-huh.
3207	4	A	and, you know, just, you see a lot of things like you, you know, was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired,
3207	4	A	and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now.
3207	6	B	right.
3207	4	A	but he refuses to consider any other,
3207	5	A	i don't,
3207	13	B	to put her in a rest home?
3207	19	A	yeah,
3207	13	A	and is that how your parents feel
3207	5	A	or,
3207	39	B	um, well, see it's more my grandma that feels that way.
3207	6	A	uh-huh.
3207	4	B	she says that when her husband died that he said, oh, that my uncle had said that he would never ha-, put her in a rest home.
3207	5	B	so it's kind of, uh,
3207	28	B	i don't know.
3207	4	B	i mean, i don't, i don't think my parents would
3207	4	B	but she is getting pretty bad
3207	4	B	like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed
3207	5	B	and,
3207	6	A	uh-huh.
3207	7	B	it's,
3207	4	B	and my mom has to take care of her pretty much
3207	5	B	so it gets,
3207	28	B	i don't know.
3207	2	B	it's, it's a hard decision,
3207	4	B	but i don't think i would do it to my parents personally .
3207	5	A	i know at this,
3207	4	A	i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either, you know.
3207	4	A	but i, i really feel bad for the people i see th-, not very,
3207	4	A	i'm not really, really experienced
3207	4	A	but like i said i just have that one family,
3207	4	A	and i just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now
3207	4	A	and, than he thought it would be.
3207	5	A	but,
3207	20	B	when he retired?
3207	19	A	yeah,
3207	4	A	and he's got, you know, seven brothers and sisters
3207	4	A	and, and, uh, he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone.
3207	5	A	and,
3207	6	B	yeah,
3207	4	B	it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my, and my mom switch off like we have her for three months
3207	4	B	and then he has her for three months.
3207	9	A	oh, well, that's great.
3207	4	B	so  that,
3207	9	A	that's a good idea.
3207	5	A	we ought to,
3207	7	B	that  works out good.
3207	6	A	yeah,
3207	4	A	and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever, i don't know what they're going to do.
3207	4	A	it's really not my family.
3207	4	A	it's my fiancee's
3207	4	A	so i don't, i can't say much.
3207	6	B	uh-huh.
3207	4	A	but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either
3207	4	A	and i wonder, i'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children
3207	4	A	so if my parents do need to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for.
3207	18	B	really?
3207	7	A	you know,
3207	5	A	and i'm, i,
3207	4	A	that's fine with me.
3207	4	A	i-, my fiancee and i both figure that's what's, we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever.
3207	5	A	if the-,
3207	16	B	<Laughter>.
3207	8	A	you know what i mean?
3207	4	A	we feel like,
3207	6	B	uh-huh.
3207	7	A	it's our responsibility,
3207	4	A	and i feel like i would never put them in a home.
3207	4	A	but i wonder how much, you know, if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something.
3207	6	B	uh-huh.
3207	2	A	you think about it
3207	5	A	and it's really,
3207	28	A	i don't know.
3207	2	A	this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country.
3207	18	B	you think?
3207	4	B	i, i --
3207	2	A	and,
3207	7	B	i'm  not really familiar with how other countries,
3207	7	A	it's really more of a, um, like a respect issue th-, that the older, older people in other countries that i've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people
3207	2	A	and, and they really seem as wise
3207	2	A	and, and in this country  nobody really,
3207	2	B	they're seen as senile .
3207	7	A	yeah, nobody really  pays attention
3207	2	A	and they, oh, the old-timer made with the old way
3207	2	A	and nobody respects the traditions.
3207	5	A	and, you know, it's i,
3207	4	A	i'm not saying that i do either
3207	2	A	but
3207	6	B	right.
3207	7	A	you know, it's just funny
3207	2	A	and, and we really don't have any that don't have the social security
3207	2	A	and everything really isn't that much
3207	6	B	uh-huh.
3207	7	A	for elderly people to live on.
3207	2	A	you know, even if they're in good health it's incredible.
3207	6	B	right.
3207	2	A	they don't have any,
3207	2	A	they don't get special treatment and maybe they should, you know
3207	6	B	uh-huh.
3207	7	A	because we're all going to get old someday.
3207	3	B	i know.
3207	2	A	and so it's a, it's kind of a depressing topic though.
3207	20	A	how old are you?
3207	4	B	um, i'm twenty.
3207	13	A	so it is, yeah, and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother.
3207	19	B	yeah,
3207	4	B	it's,
3207	16	A	.
3207	7	B	it really is
3207	4	B	but, and she, she drives us craz-,
3239	13	A	well, do you have any pets?
3239	19	B	yes
3239	4	B	i do.
3239	4	B	i have a dog named grisly, who's a ten year old, uh, mixed breed between golden retriever, afghan hound and chow.
3239	14	A	oh.
3239	4	B	and i have a pair of box turtles.
3239	14	A	oh,
3239	16	B	<Laughter>.
3239	4	A	i used to have box turtles, um, well, years ago, when i was growing up
3239	6	B	yeah,
3239	4	A	i, i really like them.
3239	6	B	oh, yeah,
3239	4	B	i do, too.
3239	4	B	lucky and spot, that's their names
3239	6	A	oh.
3239	4	B	and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room,
3239	4	B	and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle,
3239	16	A	<Laughter>.
3239	7	B	and always has his nose all around my turtle box,
3239	13	B	so do you have any pets now?
3239	19	A	yes,
3239	4	A	um, we have one dog, a bichon frise.
3239	4	A	um, our friends in houston bred the dogs.
3239	4	A	i had never heard of them
3239	26	B	no,
3239	4	B	i haven't either.
3239	4	A	they're, um, they're all white
3239	4	A	and they're small, and, um, and fluffy,
3239	4	A	they don't shed.
3239	4	A	i guess they're distantly related to a poodle,
3239	4	A	but they're not very well known in this country,
3239	4	A	and they're not, um, high strung or over bred
3239	6	B	oh.
3239	7	A	um.
3239	20	B	and how big do they get.
3239	4	A	ours is, uh, on the small end,
3239	4	A	and she's about ten pounds,
3239	4	A	and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds
3239	9	B	oh, that's interesting.
3239	4	A	and they love people, um, and kids
3239	4	A	and that was something we were looking for, um,
3239	4	A	our, our love is golden retrievers,
3239	4	A	and that's what we had intended to get in houston,
3239	4	A	but we had a small yard and a pool
3239	4	A	and knowing how they love to dig
3239	5	B	ye-,
3239	2	B	the water,
3239	5	B	yes.
3239	7	A	and love the water, um, and we thought that was kind of a tough climate
3239	6	B	yeah.
3239	4	A	so, uh, we ended up getting this,
3239	4	A	and, uh, my son would rather have a golden retriever, though, i think
3239	6	B	oh.
3239	4	A	now he wants a, a good size dog .
3239	6	B	uh-huh,
3239	4	B	well, we've got a good size dog,
3239	4	B	and we were considering getting a puppy, a small house, lap top dog for him, because he likes other animals and for me, because we used to have a miniature dachshund,
3239	4	B	and i miss
3239	6	A	oh.
3239	7	B	having a little one
3239	6	A	yeah.
3239	7	B	you know, around.
3239	9	B	the kind you have sounds very interesting, though.
3239	4	A	well, they really are, um, they're really sweet dogs.
3239	4	A	we've, uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and, and bred them.
3239	4	A	they had five litters of puppies,
3239	4	A	and
3239	6	B	oh.
3239	7	A	and  a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood
3239	6	B	uh-huh.
3239	5	A	because, um,
3239	20	B	and how do you spell that breed?
3239	4	A	it's b i c h o n f r i s e.
3239	30	B	f r i s e.
3239	20	B	and how do you pronounce that?
3239	4	A	bichon frise.
3239	14	B	okay.
3239	4	B	i'm writing it out phonetically,
3239	6	A	yeah.
3239	5	A	they're, uh,
3239	4	A	and they don't shed
3239	2	A	so they're, they're good dogs for people with, with
3239	6	B	yes,
3239	7	A	allergies,
3239	4	A	and they love people,
3239	5	A	and they're,
3239	13	B	do they bark a lot?
3239	26	A	um, no,
3239	4	A	not really.
3239	4	A	ours, um, ours barks more than, um, than some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends' house.
3239	4	A	we used to swap back and forth dogs.
3239	4	A	they have three dogs.
3239	4	A	they had a cockapoo, and, and two bichons
3239	6	B	uh-huh.
3239	7	A	um,
3239	4	A	and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there
3239	14	B	oh.
3239	4	A	and, uh, now it's funny.
3239	4	A	she's, she's a good watch dog
3239	6	B	uh-huh.
3239	4	A	and if there's, she'll bark that way,
3239	4	A	but she also talks a lot,
3239	4	A	she
3239	6	B	yes.
3239	7	A	um, has a definite personality
3239	4	A	and so, if we're leaving her, she barks at us, because
3239	6	B	oh.
3239	7	A	she doesn't want to be left. um.
3239	13	B	does she ever mess in the house?
3239	26	A	no,
3239	26	A	no,
3239	4	A	and they're, um, they're very smart dogs.
3239	4	A	the circuses in europe used to use them
3239	6	B	oh.
3239	7	A	um, for the acts.
3239	4	A	they, uh, oh, they'll dance
3239	6	B	uh-huh.
3239	7	A	on their hind legs each
3239	9	B	oh, gee.
3239	4	A	um, but they're very easy to train
3239	6	B	uh-huh.
3239	5	A	and,
3239	20	B	and about how much are they?
3239	5	A	well, they range,
3239	21	A	i'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper.
3239	4	A	they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars, i think
3239	20	B	and how about the,
3239	7	A	which i thought was a lot.
3239	7	B	and how about the  person in, uh, houston?
3239	39	A	well, she's no longer breeding them
3239	14	B	oh.
3239	4	A	but, um, because her dogs, um, the, the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter,
3239	4	A	and, uh, the one male that she used had a tooth problem
3239	6	B	uh-huh.
3239	4	A	and so she only bred that dog once because it had
3239	6	B	oh, yes.
3239	7	A	the tooth problem, and did them strictly as, um, pets, you know
3239	6	B	just pets,
3239	7	A	they weren't, weren't show quality.
3239	6	B	yes,
3239	4	B	that's what we'd rather have is just a pet, instead of --
3239	6	A	ri-,
3239	4	B	we used to show saint bernards when i was a little girl.
3239	4	B	we did that every weekend,
3239	2	A	oh, but, yeah, takes a lot of time.
3239	3	B	yes,
3239	2	B	and it's very expensive.
3239	3	A	yeah,
3239	4	A	um, but she might have some contacts here,
3239	4	A	i know origina-, i know that the dog's grandmother, um, was from plano,
3239	4	B	oh, that's where i live,
3239	4	A	oh, that's where i live, too.
3239	6	B	yeah,
3239	4	B	i'm at coit and legacy ...
3246	13	A	do you see anything wrong with public school systems?
3246	19	B	well, yes,
3246	4	B	i do.
3246	4	B	um, i think i'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to, to deal with in some quality way.
3246	2	B	i think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job.
3246	3	A	i agree.
3246	13	B	do you?
3246	13	B	do you have children in the public school system?
3246	19	A	yes,
3246	4	A	and i taught for fourteen years
3246	6	B	is that right.
3246	7	A	before we moved to texas,
3246	4	A	and the, the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much
3246	4	A	i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students,
3246	4	A	and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms
3246	29	B	you were a bookkeeper .
3246	7	A	for all the children
3246	6	B	oh.
3246	4	A	everything had to be documented,
3246	4	A	and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids,
3246	4	A	it was filled with documentation
3246	9	B	oh, no.
3246	3	A	yes.
3246	4	B	well, um, i'm, i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back,
3246	4	B	and, and i'm just really in a dilemma if that's what, you know,
3246	4	B	i love to work with children and
3246	4	A	me, too.
3246	7	B	to teach them,
3246	4	B	but i'm really having questions if, if i can deal with that system and, and have a good conscience about, you know, what i do.
3246	2	B	i don't think, i don't think it's the teachers,
3246	2	B	i think it's the system
3246	3	A	i think so too.
3246	5	B	but, um.
3246	2	A	they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now
3246	6	B	right.
3246	7	A	and teacher competency, you know,
3246	2	A	and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best,
3246	2	A	she's always worried who's looking over her shoulder
3246	5	A	and,
3246	2	B	what child's going to say something
3246	3	A	that's right.
3246	7	B	some parent's going to overreact to
3246	3	A	i know.
3246	3	B	that's, that's true.
3246	2	B	well, it's, it's hard on the children too,
3246	2	B	i think, you know, because the, um, the teachers are overworked
3246	2	B	and just like a mommy that's overworked
3246	3	A	that's right.
3246	7	B	you're not at your best, you know, um.
3246	13	A	do you have children in the system?
3246	23	B	i have two,
3246	23	B	i have, in the system
3246	4	B	one is in ninth grade
3246	4	B	and one is in seventh grade,
3246	5	B	and them,
3246	4	B	um, i'm home schooling my kindergartner this year.
3246	14	A	oh.
3246	4	B	we, um, live in a district that has open classrooms,
3246	4	B	and i wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her.
3246	6	A	yep.
3246	13	A	are you in plano?
3246	19	B	yes.
3246	6	A	yep,
3246	4	A	i am too.
3246	6	B	you too.
3246	4	A	and i have one in ninth grade at clark
3246	4	A	and one at hendrick this year,
3246	4	A	and he, my nin-, my, uh, sixth grader came from an open classroom at matthews,
3246	4	A	and the very first year i taught back in seventy-three, we had open classroom
3246	4	A	and it didn't work then
3246	6	B	oh.
3246	4	A	and when we moved down here, i was just appalled that they were still doing
3246	6	B	still at it.
3246	7	A	it here,
3246	4	B	well the explanation i was, was given about, you know,
3246	4	B	they, they seemed to admit that it wasn't working,
3246	4	B	but they didn't have the money to restructure,
3246	2	B	but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with, i mean, some kind of partitions
3246	6	A	partitions
3246	7	B	you know,
3246	2	A	or just to face the children different directions or to do something
3246	5	B	just,
3246	5	B	yeah.
3246	4	A	i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school
3246	9	B	oh, goodness.
3246	4	A	so he spent all day
3246	6	B	oh.
3246	7	A	in this one large open area,
3246	4	A	so, i didn't really care for that.
3246	4	A	it seems like the schools in michigan were much better than they are down here.
3246	18	B	were they?
3246	4	A	that was our last tour, in michigan.
3246	4	B	well, we were from north, um, carolina,
3246	4	B	and of course north, north carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education.
3246	4	B	i think they rank about forty-ninth
3246	6	A	oh.
3246	4	B	but our children got a very good education there
3246	6	A	uh-huh.
3246	4	B	they were in the magnet school program,
3246	4	B	and a lot of their classes, from the time they were about third grade,  they, they changed classes  several times during the day, which has its pros and cons,
3246	4	B	but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes
3246	9	A	oh, wow.
3246	4	B	and it was wonderful
3246	3	A	yes.
3246	4	B	so, you know, i'm coming to, to plano thinking, well, gosh, it's going to be really great,
3246	4	B	it's ranked so much better .
3246	3	A	yes,
3246	3	A	that's right.
3246	4	A	we heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system.
3246	9	B	isn't that interesting,
3246	2	B	i, i, i don't understand how they get this, this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money,
3246	28	B	i don't know.
3246	3	A	probably so, on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are
3246	3	B	i guess so.
3246	5	A	so.
3246	4	B	well, my son is at clark this year too,
3246	5	B	so, uh, we're
3246	13	A	as a freshman?
3246	19	B	yeah.
3246	6	A	yep.
3246	4	B	and, uh, he's pleased with his classes.
3246	4	B	i, i, i don't guess i've been in the high school long enough to, to know what to expect really
3246	6	A	yeah.
3246	7	B	you know, how to judge it.
3246	4	A	my daughter seems to be having a good time,
3246	4	A	she was absent with strep throat the last three days,
3246	4	A	and i ran over and picked up her report card,
3246	4	A	and she did very good,
3246	4	A	so --
3246	9	B	well, that's good.
3246	7	A	and  she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of home work i would expect
3246	6	B	yeah.
3246	7	A	for a freshman to have.
3246	4	A	she's not bogged down,
3246	4	A	but yet she has some every night.
3246	4	B	well, eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any,
3246	9	B	so, that's interesting,
3246	4	B	but, he, his grades, i haven't seen them yet,
3246	4	B	but supposedly they're good,
3246	5	B	so,
3246	6	A	yes,
3246	2	A	you always hear how good.
3246	4	A	now my son's at,
3246	16	B	<Laughter>.
3246	7	A	junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful
3246	8	A	but,
3246	16	B	<Laughter>.
3246	7	A	who knows what he's going to bring home.
3246	3	B	that's right.
3250	0	A	okay.
3250	11	B	why don't you go ahead and start.
3250	3	A	okay,
3250	4	A	well, we subscribe to people magazine and to time,
3250	4	A	and, of course i like the people magazine because it's gossipy
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	7	A	and it's fast reading,
3250	2	A	and, uh, the time of course, is, uh, you know, more newsworthy
3250	2	A	and, uh, it has more world affair type things, of course.
3250	4	A	and then i will purchase a good housekeeping occasionally, especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas  and --
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	7	A	and  things like that
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	13	A	and, uh, do you subscribe to any magazines?
3250	6	B	yeah,
3250	4	B	i, well, i have, in a whi-, for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because, uh, i have so much going on in my life
3250	4	B	that seems to be the last thing i pick up,
3250	4	B	so i found that i was wasting my money. as much as i enjoy them, uh, when i do subscribe
3250	4	B	i, i've gotten in the past the parents magazine and, uh, the housekeeping magazine
3250	6	A	uh-huh
3250	5	B	uh.
3250	13	A	you probably have smaller children
3250	19	B	yes,
3250	19	B	yeah,
3250	7	A	younger children.
3250	4	A	my children, our children are grown
3250	19	B	yeah,
3250	19	B	yeah,
3250	4	A	and, uh, i'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren .
3250	6	B	right,
3250	4	B	well, i found that after a couple of years of having a parents magazine it was getting repetitious,
3250	4	B	so i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason.
3250	4	B	uh, the housekeeping magazines i do like because they, like you say, they have nice, uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, uh, lately they've just been piling up on me,
3250	4	B	so i figured it wasn't, uh, something i needed at this point in time.
3250	13	A	well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to?
3250	27	B	i don't know,
3250	5	B	i, i, well,
3250	4	B	my husband would love to have more.
3250	4	B	now he's the type who will get the, uh, inc. magazine and money magazine and all the financial type magazines,
3250	6	A	yes,
3250	4	A	now my husband does that,
3250	5	A	and --
3250	6	B	yeah,
3250	4	A	you know, and of course, uh, naturally wall street journal, you know
3250	6	B	uh-huh,
3250	6	B	yes.
3250	7	A	and, or sports illustrated,
3250	28	A	but i don't know,
3250	4	A	i know a few people leafing through them at the store --
3250	7	B	uh-huh.
3250	2	A	but you just don't hear people talk about them,
3250	4	A	and i know years ago, when, uh, my children were young and stuff, i just loved ladies home journal, mccall's, good housekeeping,
3250	4	A	and i took them all
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	4	A	and, uh, then, oh, i don't know what
3250	4	A	in the seventies, maybe, late seventies they changed their format
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	5	A	and i haven't,
3250	2	A	i don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be
3250	6	B	well --
3250	2	A	even good housekeeping i don't,
3250	6	B	yeah,
3250	2	B	and some of those have had what, what i consider or what
3250	2	B	i get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines.
3250	2	B	they seem just to be so chocked full of, of ads.
3250	3	A	oh, they are.
3250	4	A	my sister, uh, takes, uh, town and country and vogue
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	4	A	and she sends them to me,
3250	2	A	and there's really nothing in them but advertisements
3250	6	B	yeah,
3250	6	B	yeah,
3250	7	A	for very expensive clothes, very expensive jewelry
3250	6	B	yes.
3250	7	A	things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing
3250	6	B	right .
3250	4	A	you know, and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living
3250	6	B	yes.
3250	7	A	you know, then i can, i look through them
3250	6	B	yeah.
3250	4	A	and i do,
3250	5	A	i just,
3250	4	A	what i do is i flip through them and, and pitch them then, you know,
3250	4	A	they're not something i, you know, take any length of time over.
3250	6	B	uh-huh,
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	4	A	i have discovered that, you know, with my available time, i would rather actually read a book
3250	6	B	yes
3250	7	A	than a magazine.
3250	4	B	i enjoy books a lot more
3250	6	A	yes
3250	2	B	that's true.
3250	5	A	and, uh.
3250	5	B	well
3250	5	A	so, but.
3250	4	B	now i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to,
3250	4	B	other than my children have gotten.
3250	4	B	you know, they get tons of magazines it seems
3250	6	A	yes .
3250	4	B	they're always getting something in the mail
3250	4	B	and, and, uh, so between reading to them and, uh, reading the newspaper,
3250	4	B	and then i have a book that i'm occasionally reading when i get a chance,
3250	4	B	but i just don't get a chance for those, uh, newsy magazines, the ones that are full of ads,
3250	2	B	unless you just want to skim through while you're,
3250	4	B	i, i read them when i'm at a doctor's office or, you know, waiting on something like that.
3250	6	A	yes,
3250	6	A	yes,
3250	4	A	i will read them in a doctor's office, too.
3250	6	B	yeah,
3250	4	A	as i said, i, i subscribe to, uh, to people and to time,
3250	4	A	and, uh, and i will go through the time, but, usually not cover to cover, you know,
3250	4	A	i'll glance through it.
3250	4	A	i like reading, uh, you know, the passage of people or something
3250	6	B	uh-huh,
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	7	A	you know,
3250	4	A	and, uh, but i do like the people magazine.
3250	4	A	it, it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young
3250	6	B	oh, uh-huh.
3250	4	A	and, uh, that's one, and you know, i really like that,
3250	4	A	i enjoy that.
3250	4	A	it's quick reading
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	7	A	you know,
3250	4	A	it doesn't require a lot of thinking,
3250	4	A	and sometimes after i've worked all day
3250	6	B	yeah.
3250	7	A	and have things to do at night, i just, i want fluff
3250	6	B	uh-huh,
3250	6	B	uh-huh.
3250	4	A	i don't want a lot of thinking .
3250	9	B	that's true,
3250	2	B	that kind of is a good way to do it.
3250	4	A	it, uh, you know,  it's, it's  much more relaxing.
3250	4	A	sometimes when i read time magazine, after i've read an article i'm real depressed over the situation of the world ,
3250	16	B	<Laughter>.
3250	2	A	so. well, it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines
3250	6	B	yeah,
3250	6	B	yeah.
3250	5	A	and, uh --
3250	12	B	okay.
3250	12	A	so, uh, i think that probably i will end the call.
3250	12	A	i've enjoyed,
3251	0	B	okay,
3251	4	B	i missed a part of it.
3251	13	B	we're to talk about what, lawns and gardens?
3251	4	A	lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do.
3251	4	A	i'm, i'm a putterer.
3251	4	A	i chose that topic because i really like gardening
3251	6	B	uh-huh.
3251	7	A	as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard.
3251	6	B	uh-huh.
3251	5	B	i, well,
3251	4	B	it's, it's, it's very str-, strange that i got this call because my wife just called me.
3251	4	B	i was just in the shower after finishing  mowing the lawn
3251	6	A	oh.
3251	7	B	and,  you know, mowing the lawn and  removing some old petunias out of the garden,
3251	4	B	this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall, fall bulbs.
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	5	B	uh.
3251	4	A	we've had a late fall
3251	4	A	it seems like, the weather,
3251	4	A	in fact today it's really warm,
3251	4	A	and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up,
3251	2	A	but you know you need to pretty soon.
3251	4	B	well, that's the way this was.
3251	4	B	the, the petunias were really great.
3251	4	B	our mums are, are beautiful,
3251	6	A	oh.
3251	4	B	uh, i don't know if we, i don't think we've had a frost up here.
3251	4	B	i've been, i was down in for a week,
3251	4	B	so i don't know what happened last week
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	4	B	uh, but, uh, it seems like it's, i don't know if it's late.
3251	4	B	i'm sort of waiting for indian summer
3251	4	B	so i can get a lot of stuff down out here.
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	4	B	uh, i, i enjoy it.
3251	4	B	we came here, we just moved into this, well, we moved in in november and put all, all the landscaping in this, this year.
3251	4	B	we came from nine years in a condo, uh,
3251	4	B	and working in that condo, you didn't have to do anything
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	7	B	you know, unless you really wanted to,
3251	5	B	so
3251	29	A	so now
3251	7	B	.
3251	7	A	you have the chance to really create and, and spread out.
3251	3	B	right.
3251	5	B	you know, i can't,
3251	4	B	this is my third, third house i think, i've owned, um,
3251	4	B	but, uh, it's interesting, you know,
3251	4	B	the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling,
3251	4	B	and it sort of gets away from me
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	7	B	if you're not with it.
3251	4	B	so, but, uh, i, i enjoy most of it,
3251	4	B	and about this time of year there is, it starts getting a little old,
3251	4	B	and i start looking forward to, you know, having other things to do with my
3251	29	A	the grass
3251	7	B	.
3251	7	A	not growing so fast .
3251	31	B	well, it is, it is for me
3251	4	B	because i've been doing a lot of fertilizing.
3251	4	B	we had a terrible summer,
3251	4	B	we had a drought
3251	6	A	oh.
3251	4	B	and, uh, took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing,
3251	4	B	and now it's really growing
3251	4	B	and i'm trying to establish a good root, root growth
3251	5	A	um
3251	7	B	you know, for the winter.
3251	4	A	ours seems to have slowed down here.
3251	4	A	we're not having to mow every week religiously
3251	6	B	really.
3251	4	A	but we're still fighting bugs, and ready to change some of the, the summer flowers out
3251	5	B	uh.
3251	4	A	i still have caladiums that are pretty, which is a surprise this late in the year.
3251	18	B	oh, really?
3251	19	A	uh-huh.
3251	5	B	um.
3251	4	A	but like today, it's eighty-five degrees
3251	6	B	oh, yeah
3251	4	A	it's really strange,
3251	6	B	yeah,
3251	4	B	i hear that from, my brother-in-law lives in plano,
3251	4	A	but that'll change
3251	6	B	yeah .
3251	7	A	real quick .
3251	4	B	well, he always --
3251	4	A	we'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already.
3251	4	B	he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here
3251	4	B	and then he calls us,
3251	9	A	oh, my gosh.
3251	6	B	yeah
3251	4	B	it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine.
3251	5	B	so .
3251	4	A	well, texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants, because our summers are so terribly hot
3251	5	B	.
3251	4	A	and we have ice storms every year.
3251	4	A	and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those
3251	6	B	uh-huh.
3251	7	A	extremes.
3251	4	A	some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings.
3251	6	B	yeah,
3251	5	B	that is,
3251	4	B	i was, you know, i was like conditioned to it
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	4	B	they, they have to be hardened to it
3251	4	B	that's, that's strange with me.
3251	4	B	you know, you think, dallas, you know, almost semitropical, you wouldn't have that kind of, that kind of problem,
3251	5	B	but,
3251	4	A	well, for the most part we don't,
3251	4	A	but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold.
3251	4	A	well, the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter
3251	6	B	uh-huh.
3251	4	A	but the, the ice storms really are stressful on all the, the plants that we have around.
3251	4	A	we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to
3251	6	B	really,
3251	18	B	oh do they.
3251	7	A	and, uh, pittosporum
3251	4	A	that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time
3251	6	B	uh-huh.
3251	4	A	you, you
3251	4	B	i love,
3251	7	A	really take a chance with them freezing,
3251	6	B	yeah,
3251	4	B	i love the, uh, the landscaping,
3251	4	B	like i say, my brother-in-law . i get to carrollton quite a bit.
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	4	B	i go there on business,
3251	4	B	and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens,
3251	4	B	and texas is,
3251	4	B	d-, dallas is very nice.
3251	4	B	i really enjoy it there. the landscaping, the homes, the architecture, the whole thing
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	7	B	very enjoyable gardens,
3251	4	B	and my wife and i,
3251	4	A	except for the lack of trees, out where we are # . #
3251	5	B	# well. #
3251	7	A	it was all cotton fields,
3251	4	A	and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful, we really miss it.
3251	6	B	yeah,
3251	4	B	that we have, you know --
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	4	B	ohio's a very pretty state.
3251	4	B	we moved, in seventy-six we moved to chicago,
3251	4	B	we lived there for five years,
3251	4	B	and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt,
3251	4	B	uh, we were coming in
3251	4	B	and before the plane landed she looked out the window
3251	4	B	and she said, she said, there's no trees down there.
3251	16	A	<Laughter>.
3251	33	B	this is illinois,
3251	33	B	you're not.
3251	4	B	and, when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house, there were no trees
3251	5	A	um.
3251	7	B	because the farmers had cleared all the land
3251	6	A	uh-huh.
3251	4	B	and now all of a sudden it was being developed,
3251	4	B	and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees,
3255	0	A	okay,
3255	2	A	for as far as, um, i would think the, probably the, uh, worst substance that's probably, um,
3255	5	A	or, started to say the, uh,
3255	2	A	what causes the most air pollution is probably the car
3255	9	B	probably so,
3255	2	A	and, uh, whether or not, um, they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh, train or, or something like that
3255	5	A	or,
3255	3	B	yeah,
3255	2	B	it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.
3255	3	A	yeah,
3255	9	A	that's exactly it,
3255	4	A	and that's what we're finding, um, here, where we're at, in minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	that there are inconveniences to that,
3255	2	A	or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing,
3255	2	A	so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, i think the majority of the people do not carpool.
3255	3	B	i think so too.
3255	4	B	i'm in texas
3255	6	A	uh-huh.
3255	4	B	and very few people carpool
3255	6	A	yeah.
3255	4	B	uh, the people that i know don't want to because, uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job
3255	3	A	exactly.
3255	4	B	they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know,
3255	6	A	uh-huh,
3255	7	B	they just feel they need their car.
3255	24	A	or if somebody gets sick.
3255	6	A	yeah,
3255	2	A	or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	then they're, they're stuck,
3255	2	A	you're
3255	9	B	that's right.
3255	7	A	definitely right,
3255	0	A	so, *slash error
3255	2	B	and people don't want to give it up
3255	7	A	yes, / *slash error
3255	2	B	but now i think we've made great strides
3255	6	A	uh-huh.
3255	7	B	in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline  and
3255	6	A	sure.
3255	7	B	and  to change the car itself
3255	3	A	sure,
3255	4	A	that happens quite a bit,
3255	2	B	but, uh, you know, i, i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent
3255	6	A	yes,
3255	6	A	yeah
3255	5	B	but
3255	9	A	that's very true.
3255	7	B	yeah. *should this be two slash units?
3255	4	A	uh, other than that, uh, i don't know,
3255	4	B	well, my other line is ringing
3255	6	A	okay.
3255	11	B	but we're going to ignore it .
3255	3	A	oh, okay,
3255	11	A	we'll try to be real quick here.
3255	10	B	i'm sorry for these beeps,
3255	20	A	the other thing then is, because i don't know how long they want us to talk,
3255	4	B	oh, close to five minutes, i believe.
3255	30	A	five minutes, oh, okay.
3255	13	B	and you're in minneapolis,
3255	23	A	minneapolis area,
3255	13	B	well, is the pollution really bad up there?
3255	36	A	uh, actually no.
3255	4	A	we have, uh, quite a bit, uh,
3255	2	A	the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	and of course hay fever season
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	4	A	you get some pollutants such as those,
3255	2	A	but those are natural
3255	6	B	yeah
3255	16	B	<sniffing>.
3255	5	A	um, but there is starting to,
3255	4	A	in minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution,
3255	4	A	and
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	you have to have your car inspected
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	or other pollutants,
3255	4	A	and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,
3255	4	B	well
3255	5	A	at least where you .
3255	7	B	that's the way it has gotten here.
3255	4	B	we have just had that law, i think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in texas
3255	6	A	sure,
3255	6	A	yeah,
3255	2	B	but, uh, i think it's a good idea
3255	3	A	yeah,
3255	2	A	it's not a bad idea.
3255	7	B	because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars
3255	6	A	uh-huh.
3255	7	B	which you can't blame them for that
3255	6	A	sure,
3255	6	A	sure,
3255	2	B	and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed
3255	3	A	exactly,
3255	4	B	and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c -s
3255	6	A	uh-huh.
3255	7	B	that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air
3255	6	A	sure.
3255	7	B	they're having to change the type of products they use
3255	6	A	uh-huh.
3255	5	B	uh, they can't use,
3255	4	B	like, i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
3255	6	A	uh-huh.
3255	4	B	and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning syst-, systems
3255	6	A	sure.
3255	4	B	therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever
3255	6	A	uh-huh.
3255	7	B	it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
3255	6	A	sure.
3255	4	B	and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many c f c -s into the atmosphere
3255	6	A	uh-huh.
3255	7	B	it doesn't cost as much
3255	6	A	yeah.
3255	7	B	so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,
3255	6	A	sure
3255	5	B	but,
3255	2	A	uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, i'm sure
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	over there it's a necessity
3255	6	B	right.
3255	7	A	versus something up here we can live without it
3255	2	A	but it's uncomfortable
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	4	A	but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done,
3255	4	A	and one of the cans released entire amount
3255	5	B	um.
3255	7	A	of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it,
3255	4	A	and, i don't know
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that,
3255	4	A	and i was thinking how many other people --
3255	2	B	it's probably happened to millions of people,
3255	9	A	oh, sure,
3255	2	A	because
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	7	A	if you take it into a service station,
3255	16	B	<Sniffing>.
3255	7	A	they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	2	A	so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, hey,  that's
3255	6	B	uh-huh
3255	7	A	that's  right there.
3255	4	A	i think it's like three or four dollars a, a can
3255	6	B	yeah.
3255	4	A	and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car,
3255	4	A	and i, i thought about that,
3255	4	A	and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he breathed it
3255	24	B	inhaled so much of it,
3255	6	B	uh-huh.
3255	4	A	but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that
3255	0	A	and, *slash error
3255	6	B	yeah,
3255	5	B	well, of course in the, uh,
3255	2	B	i think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays
3255	7	A	uh-huh. / *slash error
3255	7	B	we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here
3255	3	A	exactly.
3255	7	B	nearly everything is in the pump squirt,
3255	6	A	pump, yeah, *should this be two slash units?
3257	20	A	what do you like to watch on television ?
3257	4	B	well, i guess a lot of the, uh,
3257	4	B	something that's kind of more of a comedy.
3257	4	B	we do have, uh, cable,
3257	4	B	and we have premium stations like h b o and showtime and such,
3257	4	B	and i guess a lot of times when i first turn the t v on, i, i normally go to those, because i pay for them
3257	6	A	yes .
3257	4	B	i guess i, i want to see if there's anything i really want to see there, so i don't end up watching the, um, prime time on some of the standard channels as much, i tend to go to my premium channels first,
3257	6	A	uh-huh,
3257	6	A	uh-huh.
3257	4	A	well we have cable,
3257	4	A	but we only have cinemax,
3257	4	A	and
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	7	A	uh, i think our favorite night is, uh, monday night,
3257	4	A	and we start out with evening shade
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	7	A	and major dad,
3257	4	A	and
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	7	A	i think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.
3257	4	A	you know
3257	6	B	yeah.
3257	7	A	my husband's always got it on.
3257	4	A	i'm not always sitting down,
3257	5	A	and,
3257	2	B	monday night's pretty good with murphy brown
3257	3	A	yes.
3257	7	B	and designing women.
3257	3	A	yes,
3257	3	A	yes.
3257	2	A	i just, i love that,  all those, that  two hours
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	4	A	and, uh, now tonight i just finished up with that a woman called jackie,
3257	13	A	did you watch
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	7	A	did you watch  it?
3257	23	B	we had watched it, uh, i guess sunday night and monday night,
3257	4	B	but we didn't get to watch it tonight.
3257	6	A	yeah,
3257	2	A	it, it was pretty good,
3257	4	A	it, uh, sometimes i like a dramatization,
3257	4	A	and i like, uh, u s a, when they had their, uh, uh, mystery movies and things, their
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	7	A	made for t v movies
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	4	A	and, uh, i like those.
3257	4	A	we very seldom watch any, uh, public television, channel thirteen.
3257	13	A	do you watch it much?
3257	4	B	the only night we tend to watch some of that is on sunday nights, starting fairly late, like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight.
3257	2	B	they have some british comedy
3257	6	A	yes.
3257	7	B	that we've, we've really liked,
3257	4	B	and there's a variety.
3257	13	B	some of them is, uh, black adder or good neighbors or yes, prime minister and are you being served?
3257	16	A	<Laughter>.
3257	4	B	they, they rotate those around,
3257	4	B	and, um, we like that british comedy.
3257	2	B	british comedy is very fast,
3257	2	B	you really have to
3257	3	A	yes
3257	7	B	listen
3257	7	A	it is. *should this be two slash units?
3257	5	B	but.
3257	4	A	now we haven't watched any of those.
3257	2	B	they're real good,
3257	2	B	but they do come on kind of late,
3257	4	B	but we really do enjoy those.
3257	4	B	sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the discovery channel.
3257	6	A	yes,
3257	4	A	now we have watched some things on that.
3257	4	B	and i'm amazed sometimes what i see on there.
3257	4	B	but i'm very intrigued.
3257	4	B	i, one time i was watching an operation,
3257	4	B	and i thought, gee,
3257	16	A	<Laughter>.
3257	7	B	i don't believe i'm watching.
3257	6	A	yeah,
3257	5	A	we had, uh,
3257	28	A	i don't know,
3257	4	A	my husband loves to, uh, that male syndrome of flicking that channel,
3257	4	A	so, you know, and he's sit in front of it
3257	4	A	and, and he went by
3257	4	A	and he said, whoops,
3257	4	A	and he backed up,
3257	4	A	and, you know, there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner
3257	6	B	yeah.
3257	7	A	you know,
3257	4	A	and i'm saying let's move right on .
3257	6	B	yeah,
3257	6	B	right,
3257	6	B	right,
3257	4	A	but our grandchildren like that discovery channel
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	7	A	if they're over here, because lots of times it will have things on, uh, animals
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	4	A	and they just thoroughly, you know, enjoy that
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	4	A	in fact, i think they were watching something on, uh, whales, or killer sh-, sharks, one or the other
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	7	A	couple of weeks ago over here
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	4	A	and, uh, so we have watched that
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	4	A	and, uh, otherwise, of course my husband's into the football
3257	6	B	oh.
3257	4	A	and, you know, i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else, you know
3257	6	B	right.
3257	7	A	with him.
3257	6	B	yeah,
3257	2	B	i'm not into watching sports.
3257	4	B	now my husband likes to watch football,
3257	4	B	he's not really into, uh, baseball or basketball too much,
3257	4	B	but, uh, football, soon as it's fall, then he likes
3257	6	A	yes.
3257	7	B	to watch college on saturday, and then of course cowboys on sunday.
3257	6	A	yes,
3257	4	A	and sometimes now we're getting that, uh, the other football where they play it inside,
3257	2	A	and you know, this is a, you know, this is too much ,
3257	16	B	<Laughter>.
3257	2	A	saturdays and sunday, this is fine,
3257	8	A	but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring
3257	6	B	yeah.
3257	7	A	you know, all of that,
3257	4	A	and, uh, but he will, uh, he'll flip around,
3257	4	A	i think the other night we had on, uh, uh, it was a, it was car races, some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down.
3257	4	A	i don't know what channel he found that on
3257	5	B	um.
3257	4	A	and, uh, but he will turn that on, especially for, if, again, if our, uh, oldest grandson is over here.
3257	4	A	he's ten
3257	6	B	uh-huh.
3257	4	A	and, uh, they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it, i, you know,
3257	16	B	<Laughter>.
3257	4	A	i keep telling them it's the same mentality you know,
3257	4	A	and something's wrong,
3257	4	A	and, uh, but, uh, and we very seldom watch television on a friday night or saturday night, because we're not home
3257	6	B	oh.
3257	4	A	and, uh, so, and sundays, uh, we usually have, all of our kids are over on sunday,
3257	4	A	so, you know, we don't get into that, except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos
3257	5	B	um.
3257	13	A	do you ever watch that?
3257	19	B	yeah,
3257	5	B	the,
3257	13	B	you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff
3257	19	A	yeah,
3257	19	A	uh-huh
3257	19	B	yeah,
3257	2	B	those are pretty good
3257	24	A	that are sometimes so dumb .
3257	7	B	but true to life,
3257	2	B	i mean, some of the,
3257	2	A	but very true to life,
3257	4	A	i mean, i've seen our family in several of those situations .
3257	16	B	<Laughter>.
3281	0	A	okay, diane.
3281	25	A	and a very good afternoon to you.
3281	25	B	and aft-, good afternoon to you.
3281	13	A	do you, uh, do most of your cooking at home
3281	15	A	or do you, uh, have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them?
3281	26	B	um, no.
3281	4	B	i do most of my cooking at home
3281	4	B	and, um, i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party.
3281	6	A	uh-huh.
3281	9	A	my goodness .
3281	16	B	<Laughter>.
3281	13	A	well, what would you, uh, like to cook?
3281	20	A	what's, what, what's, what is your favorite, uh, recipes, uh, that you would like to have
3281	6	B	um,
3281	7	A	for a dinner party?
3281	13	A	now you're in dallas, is it?
3281	23	B	right,
3281	4	B	i'm in dallas.
3281	6	A	okay.
3281	4	B	of course, um, dinner parties down here probably, oh, turn out to be more things like barbecues .
3281	5	B	and,
3281	4	A	i was, i was thinking in terms of mexican almost,
3281	6	B	uh-huh,
3281	6	B	yes.
3281	7	A	tex-, tex-mex.
3281	6	B	yeah,
3281	30	B	uh, tex-mex, uh,
3281	2	B	mexican food, um
3281	6	A	uh-huh.
3281	7	B	probably a little bit different than what you serve up in pennsylvania for a dinner party.
3281	4	A	well, that's a very interesting food though
3281	4	A	and when i go out to eat dinner sometimes
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	7	A	that's the type of foods i like to find.
3281	6	B	right.
3281	5	A	we have, uh,
3281	5	A	i think som-, chico's
3281	4	A	or, or in these different restaurants
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	7	A	in this area that, uh, have all this fine mexican foods.
3281	4	A	but, um, if i were to cook, uh, a dinner party, uh, it may be standard to you
3281	4	A	but, uh, actually i never get too much fried chicken.
3281	30	B	fried chicken.
3281	4	A	but i would have fried chicken, uh, with reasonably hot sauce on it.
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	7	A	almost a mexican type thing.
3281	4	A	and i love twice cooked potatoes.
3281	13	A	have you ever had twice cooked potatoes?
3281	19	B	oh, yes,
3281	4	B	i have.
3281	7	A	with, with a cream made of the, the sour cream and cream cheese and, uh, a little oleo and i use, uh, oregano and
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	7	A	maybe dill weed, uh, mixed in with it.
3281	6	B	right.
3281	4	A	and, uh, i like broccoli casseroles
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	7	A	which would include onion and cheese and, and more dill weed
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	7	A	and some medium hot peppers.
3281	4	A	as you can see, i'm inclined towards the mexican type of a meal .
3281	6	B	right .
3281	4	A	and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too.
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	1	A	so, uh, how would you improve upon that?
3281	30	B	oh, improve upon that?
3281	21	B	let's see.
3281	4	B	i'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in.
3281	5	B	and some,
3281	30	A	more fresh vegetables?
3281	19	B	yeah.
3281	13	A	included to that?
3281	4	B	uh, green beans and, uh
3281	6	A	uh-huh.
3281	7	B	carrots and things like that.
3281	20	A	how do you cook your green beans?
3281	30	B	my green beans?
3281	19	A	uh-huh.
3281	4	B	um, i just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes.
3281	5	A	so you h-,
3281	4	B	and i like to put a little mrs dash in with them.
3281	4	A	all right that's what i was wondering about.
3281	29	A	what, what you use and, and
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	7	A	in herbs and so forth.
3281	6	B	right,
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	4	B	um, i like to just put a tablespoon or so of mrs dash in there.
3281	6	A	uh-huh.
3281	4	B	and it makes them pretty tasty.
3281	13	A	have you ever tried chinese type green beans?
3281	30	B	the chinese type.
3281	13	B	are they the real,
3281	4	A	we use soy sauce,
3281	26	B	no,
3281	4	B	i haven't ever used that.
3281	2	A	well, you might, uh, be interested in that.
3281	13	A	have,
3281	4	A	it gives a very delicious taste.
3281	4	A	you, you have a soy sauce taste
3281	4	A	and you also have a little cream sauce in there because  you
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	7	A	you  would use the, uh, water and,
3281	20	A	uh, golly. what's this white powder that, that, uh, that you mix with water
3281	30	B	a white powder.
3281	7	A	and gives a thick sauce?
3281	4	A	i can't even think of the name of that right at the moment.
3281	9	B	um, gosh.
3281	5	A	anyhow ,
3281	16	B	<Laughter>.
3281	10	A	sorry about my mind.
3281	40	B	that's okay.
3281	4	A	but, uh, it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	4	A	and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it.
3281	5	A	if it does --
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	4	A	it, it brings out such a, so much different things  in,  uh
3281	6	B	yeah.
3281	7	A	in  the string beans.
3281	4	A	i, i like it to try them differently.
3281	4	A	i hardly ever cook them the same way twice.
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	7	A	just so i can enjoy them.
3281	11	A	so you might, uh, think about that.
3281	3	B	yeah,
3281	3	B	i might try that.
3281	2	A	chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them.
3281	6	B	oh, yes.
3281	4	B	i love chinese.
3281	4	A	and, uh, north african cooking is good
3281	30	B	north african?
3281	7	A	when you use something called couscous.
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	2	A	and that's, uh, made from, uh, i think they call it, beans.
3281	4	A	and that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous, uh, absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish.
3281	2	A	you probably have to buy that from specialty stores.
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	4	A	c o u s, c o u s.
3281	4	A	and that's a, a north african dish.
3281	4	A	they eat it one to two meals everyday
3281	6	B	huh.
3281	7	A	in north africa.
3281	4	A	and it is very very flexible.
3281	4	A	you can do a lot of things with it.
3281	4	A	it makes a fantastic, uh, uh, salad with cucumbers and,
3281	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3281	7	A	olive oil and onions
3281	5	A	and,
3281	6	B	uh-huh.
3281	9	A	oh, boy,
3281	4	A	real tasty.
3281	12	A	well, i've enjoyed talking with you,
3281	12	A	and i hope i've
3281	12	B	well, i've enjoyed
3281	7	A	given you some ideas
3281	7	B	talking with you.
3281	12	A	and, uh, that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food.
3281	12	B	oh, yes.
3281	12	A	well, thank you very much miss diane.
3281	12	B	okay,
3281	12	B	thank you.
3281	12	A	bye-bye.
3281	12	B	bye-bye.
3288	25	A	hi.
3288	20	A	so, uh, what was the last car repair you had?
3288	4	B	just recently i was kind of laughing when i, when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because, uh, i had to have my, uh, radiator flushed
3288	14	A	oh.
3288	4	B	and it was getting rusty.
3288	4	B	and the thing that they forgot to do was to, um, to also look at the hose,
3288	4	B	and i had gone about oh, two days with my new radiator flushed
3288	4	B	and the hose burst.
3288	4	B	so i was stranded out on the highway .
3288	9	A	oh, no.
3288	13	A	did you crack the block or what?
3288	26	B	no,
3288	4	B	i, i didn't do that thank goodness,
3288	4	B	but, uh, there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there, you know, left to do that
3288	4	B	but it cost me all kind of money, you know, to have that repaired after they said they were going to, they had repaired it.
3288	4	B	so that was, that was a horrible experience
3288	14	A	yeah,
3288	14	A	i see.
3288	7	B	just recently.
3288	2	A	you got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though.
3288	3	B	yes,
3288	3	B	yes.
3288	2	A	that can be pretty serious.
3288	3	B	i know.
3288	3	B	i know.
3288	1	B	what about you?
3288	4	A	oh, i guess it's been awhile for me.
3288	5	A	i'd sa-,
3288	4	A	it's been about a year.
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	6	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	i had the, uh, the water pump break on my car.
3288	14	B	oh.
3288	6	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	i was traveling, uh,
3288	4	A	i was going on my way home from thanksgiving
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	4	A	and it broke like in the middle of nowhere.
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	4	A	so, i had to get it towed and then fixed
3288	5	A	and --
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	2	A	big pain.
3288	3	B	oh, oh, i know. i know.
3288	2	B	especially when you're out on the highway.
3288	3	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	that's where i was.
3288	4	A	luckily someone came by and gave me a ride.
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	4	B	i know, well, you know, uh, living in dallas,
3288	2	B	you know we've got, uh, bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic
3288	4	B	and, uh, that was, that was horrible.
3288	6	A	yeah .
3288	5	B	you know to have the, you know,
3288	4	B	your car is fuming
3288	4	B	and everything.
3288	4	B	it's already a hundred degrees
3288	4	B	you don't need that too.
3288	16	A	<Laughter>.
3288	9	B	oh, shoot .
3288	4	B	but my car is getting old.
3288	4	B	see it's about six years old now,
3288	5	B	so.
3288	6	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	so is mine .
3288	6	B	yeah,
3288	4	B	so i got it right out of college
3288	4	B	and so it's, uh, it's starting to show the wear and tear now.
3288	6	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	i'm hoping mine gets me through.
3288	4	A	i got until may until i'm out.
3288	4	A	so when i cross that one i'll be okay.
3288	6	B	uh-huh,
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	6	B	yeah,
3288	4	B	that, uh, that was my graduation present to myself,
3288	5	B	so.
3288	9	A	oh, that's nice .
3288	3	B	yeah.
3288	3	B	yeah,
3288	3	B	i know
3288	4	B	so but gosh, it's really starting to, to wear
3288	4	B	so i've been thinking, especially now is a good time to buy a car.
3288	6	A	yeah.
3288	5	B	go-,
3288	4	B	because i can't, uh, i don't know if i want to, you know, pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown.
3288	3	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	i don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is
3288	2	A	and it's not worth it .
3288	3	B	uh-huh,
3288	3	B	uh-huh.
3288	3	B	yeah,
3288	3	B	that's true.
3288	3	B	i agree with you there.
3288	6	A	yeah.
3288	28	B	so i don't know, uh,
3288	4	B	because i, i need to have it tuned, you know, tuned up and i don't know, replace some of the belts.
3288	4	B	and i was looking at the, uh,
3288	4	B	tires need to be replaced
3288	4	B	and so i was thinking just a lot of money
3288	5	B	i'm,
3288	4	B	might as well buy me a new car for that.
3288	3	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	i got new tires last winter too
3288	4	A	so i'm like, well, that's the last major purchase for this thing.
3288	33	A	it's not worth it.
3288	3	B	uh-huh.
3288	13	B	well, you have to, in pennsylvania, boy,
3288	13	B	you have to really have your car winterized and stuff, huh?
3288	19	A	yeah.
3288	6	B	uh-huh .
3288	19	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	we get some killer winters up here in the mountains.
3288	18	B	oh, really?
3288	19	A	yeah.
3288	14	B	oh, okay.
3288	5	B	so,
3288	2	A	lot of snow and a lot of cold.
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	13	B	well, especially don't you have what, a lot of salt on the ground?
3288	19	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	at times there's a lot of it.
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	4	A	you got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance.
3288	6	B	yeah.
3288	6	B	yeah,
3288	13	B	well, rust and the, and the body too, huh?
3288	19	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	i haven't had a big problem with that though.
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	4	A	so i've been pretty lucky there.
3288	4	B	well, i think they get the new z-bart stuff and everything to where you can, um,
3288	3	A	yeah,
3288	9	A	that's usually pretty good.
3288	4	A	you just rinse it off after the winter is over and
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	7	A	done with it.
3288	3	B	yeah,
3288	5	B	and go like that so.
3288	6	A	yeah.
3288	4	A	i usually like to do most repairs on my own though.
3288	18	B	do you?
3288	19	A	yeah,
3288	4	A	just because that way i know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't.
3288	6	B	uh-huh,
3288	6	B	uh-huh.
3288	6	A	yeah.
3288	4	A	plus if something goes wrong, i know who to blame.
3288	16	B	<Laughter>.
3288	16	A	<Laughter>.
3288	4	B	well, i, i think i'm getting too old for all that.
3288	4	B	my, uh, i had four brothers
3288	4	B	and they used to drag me out underneath the car, and stuff
3288	4	B	so i can, i can do all that stuff
3288	4	B	but i, i think i'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to, to go have it done now
3288	4	B	so i can get my hands dirty.
3288	16	A	<Laughter>.
3288	6	B	so, yeah.
3288	4	B	i'm just getting, getting to that age i guess.
3288	5	B	you just don't have,
3288	4	B	your time becomes very precious
3288	4	B	so working on the car is just not one of those things i want to spend my time on anymore .
3288	29	A	more fun things to do.
3288	3	B	absolutely, absolutely.
3288	5	B	so,
3288	16	A	<Laughter>.
3288	7	B	yeah,
3288	4	B	i'm trying to, you know,
3288	4	B	i just need one,
3288	4	B	i had two cars there for a while
3288	4	B	so i wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run.
3288	9	A	well, that's nice.
3288	3	B	and yeah,
3288	4	B	so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them.
3288	6	A	yeah.
3288	30	B	and yeah,
3288	5	B	so that,
3288	2	A	one is bad enough .
3288	3	B	yes,
3288	3	B	one was bad enough.
3288	4	B	but i think i got rid of the wrong one .
3288	16	A	<Laughter>.
3288	4	B	i soon, i need a lot of repairs done on, on this one
3288	5	B	so yeah,
3288	16	A	<Laughter>.
3288	4	B	that was, uh, that was something else .
3288	12	B	well, are our five minutes up? .
3288	12	A	yeah,
3288	12	A	i was just wondering that .
3288	12	B	i, i didn't, i didn't set the time or anything to, uh,
3288	12	A	yeah,
3288	12	A	i didn't either.
3288	12	B	yeah,
3288	5	B	put ,
3288	12	A	yeah,
3288	12	A	this must be a, a hard category.
3288	12	B	well, yeah,
3288	12	B	i guess. um, you know,
3288	12	B	unless you're, um, you know, big do-it-yourselfer. um, to, you know, fix up your own cars and, and things like that.
3288	12	B	so, but i guess they were talking about experiences.
3288	5	B	you know, i, uh, uh, i did,
3288	12	B	my parents live in ohio
3288	12	B	so i, i do know something about the, you know, the really cold weather.
3288	12	B	and, uh, i've always lived down here in the south,
3288	12	B	and, oh, i took my car up there to their house
3288	12	B	and, um, i guess i had a crack in the block,
3288	12	B	and when i got up there the car,
3290	4	A	uh, the only work i do outside the home is i am an avon representative.
3290	6	B	oh, okay.
3290	4	A	and i sell family products.
3290	6	B	uh-huh.
3290	5	A	and, uh,
3290	13	B	do you,
3290	4	A	so i, i don't really, i don't really dress up a whole lot.
3290	13	A	do you work outside?
3290	39	B	well, i, i work, uh,
3290	4	B	i'm a c p a
3290	4	B	and i do contract work.
3290	14	A	oh, uh-huh.
3290	4	B	and so, and i work with another c p a who just started his own practice
3290	6	A	oh.
3290	4	B	and i work with him a couple days a week
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	4	B	and so when i go to his office or to other clients' offices, then i'll dress up
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	4	B	but otherwise it's great being at home
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	in jeans or shorts or whatever .
3290	6	A	uh-huh,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	4	B	so that, that makes it pretty nice.
3290	4	B	it's
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	kind of weird because before i used to work, you know, full time
3290	4	B	and, and, uh, it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day, just about.
3290	2	A	well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day, i think.
3290	6	B	right.
3290	6	A	yeah.
3290	6	B	right,
3290	5	B	and so it's, uh,
3290	4	B	some of my suits i haven't put on for quite a
3290	6	A	uh-huh,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	while.
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	4	B	so   it's,
3290	4	A	it's kind of nice to relax a little bit.
3290	7	B	it's,   it's  very nice.
3290	6	A	yeah.
3290	6	B	gosh,
3290	4	A	well, my, my dress up,
3290	4	A	i live out in the country also
3290	4	A	so
3290	6	B	uh-huh.
3290	7	A	what i wear depends on the weather.
3290	6	B	sure.
3290	4	A	uh, so i really, i know a lot of the avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up.
3290	6	B	uh-huh.
3290	4	A	but, i mostly dress, i try to dress nice, but for convenience, because when the weather's bad, when i go into the home i take off my shoes
3290	6	B	uh-huh.
3290	7	A	which i try to wear something easy to take off, you know
3290	6	B	right.
3290	7	A	and put on.
3290	4	A	and i don't too often take off my coat even,
3290	4	A	so, uh, i really don't have to dress up like y-, you would, like if you're in an office or something.
3290	6	B	yeah,
3290	6	B	yeah.
3290	2	B	well, i imagine that where you live, uh, you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year.
3290	7	A	uh, well, not actually because
3290	13	B	not really?
3290	7	A	we really only have maybe three, four months of, i'd say warm weather.
3290	18	B	oh, is that right?
3290	19	A	yeah,
3290	4	A	and the rest is, uh, gets into the cooler weather.
3290	6	B	uh-huh.
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	4	A	course, they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more florida type weather up here ,
3290	28	A	so i
3290	6	B	uh-huh.
3290	7	A	don't know.
3290	4	A	but for now,
3290	2	B	so you all are waiting for that .
3290	7	A	but for now,  we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and, uh, cold weather.
3290	6	B	uh-huh.
3290	7	A	and that type of thing.
3290	6	B	yeah.
3290	4	A	now, my daughter works all the time,
3290	4	A	so she dresses.
3290	2	A	i think, you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and that
3290	6	B	right.
3290	7	A	because you do have to have the appearance, a good appearance to do a good job
3290	6	B	right.
3290	7	A	where you work.
3290	6	B	yeah.
3290	4	B	well, down here it's sunny most of the time.
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	and, uh, usually warm.
3290	4	B	i mean, we had a few cool days, uh, this month,
3290	4	B	but not anything, i'm sure, compared to what you've had so far.
3290	6	A	um, uh-huh.
3290	4	B	so, i mean people are still wearing shorts
3290	4	B	and
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	and,  uh, usually around halloween it starts getting cooler,
3290	4	B	so
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	you start
3290	6	A	uh-huh,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	you know, breaking out a coat
3290	6	A	right,
3290	6	A	yeah.
3290	7	B	at that time,
3290	4	B	but, that, that lasts, you know, for a few months .
3290	13	A	did you find you wore, uh, slacks when you were working full time
3290	15	A	or  did you
3290	26	B	no.
3290	7	A	did  they wear more dresses and skirts.
3290	26	B	no,
3290	4	B	never wore slacks.
3290	30	A	no slacks.
3290	4	B	it was, i think it was one of those things where, it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them.
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	4	B	it was one of those understood things
3290	6	A	uh-huh,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	that you just, you know, either wore, you know, a dress or,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	13	A	not even a dressy slack, a dressy suit, slack suit even
3290	26	B	not,
3290	7	A	if it's all,
3290	26	B	no,
3290	4	B	not, not with what i did. uh,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	4	B	most people didn't.
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	4	B	sometimes, like the secretaries might
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	4	B	but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much.
3290	5	B	and i really, you know,
3290	2	B	there's some nice pantsuits out
3290	4	B	and --
3290	6	A	uh-huh,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	and  i wouldn't have mind-, minded, you know, wearing those
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	especially when it gets pretty cold.
3290	6	A	uh-huh,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	5	B	but, uh,
3290	4	A	i know my daughter mostly,
3290	4	A	i don't think she ever wears slacks
3290	6	B	uh-huh.
3290	7	A	to work.
3290	4	A	but i didn't know if the trend changes, you know, if, uh,
3290	2	B	you know, i think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional.
3290	4	B	i guess they
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	expect women to be in skirts
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	or dresses.
3290	2	A	look more like a woman, huh .
3290	3	B	yeah
3290	3	B	. that's right .
3290	6	A	uh-huh,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	2	B	and it's the men that make the rules .
3290	2	A	uh, well, then you, you, you know why they make them then ,
3290	16	B	<Laughter>.
3290	7	A	that way.
3290	0	B	but, no,
3290	5	B	we usually, you know,
3290	4	B	skirt and, skirt and blouse or suit or dress
3290	6	A	uh-huh,
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	is what you see down here.
3290	4	B	so it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants.
3290	6	A	yeah.
3290	4	B	no, no one can see me
3290	6	A	yeah.
3290	7	B	unless i'm, you know, g-,
3290	2	A	but, yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband, too, though
3290	6	B	yeah.
3290	7	A	at home.
3290	6	B	yeah.
3290	7	A	because that's, i, i believe,
3290	4	B	but, i'm not going to put a skirt on just for him .
3290	13	A	oh, you don't think you will, huh ?
3290	16	B	<Laughter>.
3290	4	A	well, you'll be excused because considering everything .
3290	6	B	yeah,
3290	2	B	i think that the main issue at home
3290	6	A	uh-huh.
3290	7	B	is being comfortable
3290	6	A	yeah.
3290	7	B	in your clothing .
3290	4	A	but i, i look at homemaking as a job also.
3290	6	B	right.
3290	7	A	uh, being a homemaker
3290	2	A	and i, i think sometimes we lose sight of that.
3290	6	B	yeah.
3290	7	A	uh, by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress,
3291	4	A	okay, we're being recorded.
3291	3	B	all right, ron.
3291	4	A	uh, number one, i am one hundred percent for total gun t-, control.
3291	5	A	i,
3291	30	B	total gun control.
3291	3	A	yes,
3291	4	A	i am not a member of the national rifle association
3291	4	A	and,
3291	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3291	7	A	i don't believe in hunting,
3291	4	A	and, uh, i just have had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate
3291	2	A	and i really feel that we have to do something in order to, uh, to ,
3291	3	B	yes,
3291	4	B	i, i agree something should be done,
3291	2	B	but i,  there, i  don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons, because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct will have access to weapons from somewhere
3291	2	B	and that means they'll always have an advantage over us
3291	2	B	and, uh, they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself.
3291	4	B	now, you know, i, i agree with a lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally i used to be a great hunter
3291	4	B	and in the last few years i've said, no way.
3291	4	B	matter of fact, if i find a, uh, a, a fly running around in the house, i pick him up and carry him outdoors .
3291	4	B	i, i don't even hit him with a flyswatter,
3291	4	B	so i've, uh, gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting and, and killing and that sort of thing.
3291	6	A	uh-huh.
3291	2	B	but i, i think that, uh, personally, that we do need some weapons available to most of the people.
3291	2	B	most of the people really are, uh, honest and, uh, worthy of carrying on their lives properly.
3291	4	B	uh, i'm sort of in line thinking in terms,
3291	2	B	i don't see anything wrong with this five day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon.
3291	2	B	i mean there's nothing wrong with that.
3291	13	B	do you see anything wrong with that?
3291	26	A	no,
3291	4	A	there's only one problem i have with the whole thing though, th-, is, you know, when they do it, i think our biggest problem is, yes, the, the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available.
3291	6	B	right.
3291	2	A	i think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available. and the types of the weapons.
3291	4	A	i mean there is
3291	6	B	yeah.
3291	7	A	no,
3291	4	B	i'm again-, i'm against this, uh, automatic and # semiautomatic stuff. #
3291	3	A	# right,
3291	2	A	there is,  #
3291	2	B	i don't think we should have access to those.
3291	7	A	there is  no reason for it. i mean,
3291	3	B	no.
3291	4	A	and, you know, when people say, you know, well, my god, they're, they're cutting into my civil liberties and all this, no, i, i, i take a different stand that as long as they are available and they are so readily accessed out there, then something is taken away from my civil liberties. / *separated into an additional slash unit before no,?
3291	6	B	huh .
3291	4	A	and, uh, maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun t-, control.
3291	4	A	that's, that's really not what i meant.
3291	2	A	but, i mean we need control.
3291	2	A	we've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening
3291	2	A	and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out  in the, in the
3291	6	B	yes.
3291	7	A	in the  public.
3291	2	B	and the, the people should be, uh, selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're, they're not, uh, acquiring weapons for illicit use.
3291	2	B	uh, that is not good.
3291	2	B	there's nothing wrong with a person that enjoys the mechanisms.
3291	4	B	as a matter of fact, uh, there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who, uh, brought to me a target from a rifle that he, uh, pretty well, halfway designed
3291	4	B	and he, he put together the, uh, the bullets in it
3291	6	A	uh-huh.
3291	4	B	and he was showing me that at a hundred yards, he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards.
3291	2	B	now, see from a technical point of view, that is something that, that our military people need to know about.
3291	5	A	um.
3291	2	B	so there are other interesting, uh, facets in, in guns and weapons.
3291	4	B	this is a, uh, bolt action rifle, i think he has.
3291	4	B	and he has done other things to the way the, uh, barrel sits in the, uh, the wood part of it.
3291	4	B	and, uh, he designed the, the, the bullets themselves
3291	4	B	and he has fantastic accuracy.
3291	6	A	uh-huh.
3291	4	B	just, just from a technical point of view, that interests me. not to kill anybody with it or anything with it, but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate.
3291	3	A	yes.
3291	3	A	all right,
3291	2	A	you, you sound like you're into the technology of it, which is,
3291	3	A	yeah, i agree.
3291	4	A	and, you know, and, again, i'm, my entire family are, they are all hunters
3291	6	B	uh-huh.
3291	4	A	and, you know, they, they don't appreciate my stand,
3291	4	A	and   i
3291	6	B	yeah.
3291	7	A	i  have no,  i really have no  problem with sports hunters.
3291	4	A	i really don't.
3291	2	A	it's just when they come out and they say they need an uzi in order to do some accurate or decent deer hunting, i think , i think that's totally outrageous.
3291	2	A	what's happening is people are losing,
3291	2	A	they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue.
3291	6	B	yeah.
3291	2	A	and  the issue,
3291	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3291	7	A	is,  the issue is  becoming the focus and not what is actually happening with guns.
3291	2	A	uh, i, i think something will happen.
3291	6	B	uh-huh.
3334	1	A	well, what do you know about latin american policies?
3334	2	B	well, i think they're kind of ambivalent, really.
3334	2	B	uh, i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations
3334	6	A	uh-huh.
3334	7	B	you know.
3334	16	A	
3334	0	A	huh.
3334	2	B	we, we don't know, half the time we don't know who to support.
3334	7	A	are you, uh, relating this, uh, to the, uh, affair we've got going on in haiti right now?
3334	23	B	that, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that depend on us so much
3334	6	A	right.
3334	7	B	without, you know, just telling them, running their country for them
3334	5	B	but,
3334	9	A	that, that's just it.
3334	2	B	it's got to be tough,
3334	2	B	but, i mean, uh, uh, you sure, you still have to, you know, let them know how you feel.
3334	3	A	right,
3334	2	A	i guess my concern, you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take , we're going to have supporters and we're going to have, uh, antisupporters, i guess, for lack of better term,
3334	3	A	and, uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound to upset somebody,
3334	2	A	but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance.
3334	3	B	yeah,
3334	2	B	it worries me that, uh, the economy of so many countries in, in south america and central america depend on something that damages people, like the, you know, like cocaine
3334	6	A	right.
3334	7	B	from columbia,
3334	2	B	and
3334	6	A	right.
3334	7	B	uh, , you know, of course i, i'm sure we have some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us,
3334	2	B	but --
3334	3	A	that's true.
3334	7	B	but  that is, that's a tough deal,
3334	5	B	and it,
3334	5	B	i don't think that,
3334	2	B	maybe i, maybe it's, you know, i'm reflecting how i feel about it,
3334	2	B	but i have a feeling that we, that we really don't understand basically the, the, the competing factions in lot of those countries
3334	2	B	and
3334	3	A	sure.
3334	7	B	i mean, they've been hammering , for the last, you know, ten centuries,
3334	2	B	and it's still going on,
3334	2	B	and, uh, we, we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how,
3334	16	A	<Laughter>.
3334	7	B	some times,
3334	3	A	yep,
3334	3	A	that's about the lump sum of it.
3334	4	A	well, um, i was speaking with a, a woman
3334	4	A	from, i believe she was from the honduras or guatemala, or somewhere in there,
3334	31	A	no,
3334	4	A	she was from el salvador
3334	6	B	yeah.
3334	4	A	and, uh, she was from a relatively wealthy family,
3334	4	A	and when, uh, the contras came into power, of course with,
3334	22	A	uh, oh, gosh darn, what's his face,
3334	4	A	he's in, in florida jail now,
3334	13	A	marcos --
3334	19	B	yeah,
3334	19	B	yeah.
3334	31	A	uh, no,
3334	4	A	he's, marcos is philippines,
3334	3	B	yeah,
3334	4	B	um, well, i'm blank on it.
3334	13	A	well, you know who i'm talking about.
3334	23	B	i can see his face forget his name .
3334	6	A	yeah,
3334	4	A	i, i know it, uh,
3334	2	A	anyway, when he came into power, he basically just took everybody's property, you know, just assigned it to himself.
3334	3	B	yeah,
3334	2	B	kind of nationalized it
3334	6	A	right
3334	7	B	for himself,
3334	3	A	right,
3334	4	A	and, uh, so she's been a real strong supporter of the sandinistas and has been trying to back the u s government in that respect,
3334	2	A	and in that respect i have to agree that i think we're taking the right stance
3334	6	B	yeah.
3334	7	A	uh, because they were a democracy turned, uh --
3334	24	B	dictator,
3334	3	A	yeah,
3334	3	A	right
3334	6	B	yeah.
3334	2	A	basically a dictator fascist.
3334	2	B	and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing,
3334	2	B	it just --
3334	3	A	sure.
3334	7	B	you know, unstable.
3334	1	A	well, what do you think of, uh, this, uh, u s free trade agreement we're working on with mexico?
3334	2	B	well, i think it's long overdue
3334	6	A	uh-huh.
3334	5	B	uh, i just, you know,
3334	2	B	there's so much difference in, in the economies of the two countries, i'm not, you know, i have a problem, uh, with whether it's going to work or not, you know,
3334	5	B	there's, uh, it seems like there's,
3334	5	B	and i,
3334	2	B	this may be unfair to mexico,
3334	2	B	but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in, in foreign policy a lot of the times.
3334	3	A	uh-huh,
3334	5	A	mexico,
3334	2	A	they're, i know they're trying, they're really trying, the mexican government is trying,
3334	2	A	and a lot of the larger mexican businesses are trying to, oh, make themselves americanized, i guess
3334	6	B	yeah.
3334	7	A	and, uh, which is great because that's what they basically need to do.
3334	2	A	the big problem with the united states is we have our basic nine to five schedule
3334	6	B	yeah
3334	7	A	you know,
3334	4	A	and
3334	6	B	yeah.
3334	7	A	we don't have the siesta,
3334	2	A	and there's, the cultural differences is what's, is what's kind of, it's what's really hurting, uh, the mexican people, because they've had their way of life,
3334	2	A	and we've had our way of life,
3334	5	A	and, uh,
3334	2	B	i think their, their version of the good old boy network going that,
3334	5	B	uh, you know, has a lot,
3346	0	A	okay,
3346	11	A	you want to tell me first how you feel about
3346	2	B	well
3346	7	A	the proposal,
3346	7	B	um, i, i just think the way that things are going that, um, it would be good for young people to go ahead and have, um, dedicate themselves to at least something.
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	2	B	i know, like the mormon religion, you know, they require two years of service, uh, missionary service
3346	4	A	the boys
3346	3	B	right,
3346	4	B	the boys
3346	4	A	not the girls, the boys.
3346	6	B	yeah,
3346	2	B	and, um, so, but i think it would be good for all young people
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	you know, to be able to, to do something like that
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	um, so that, um, you know, i don't know, i just feel it would be good for them to do that.
3346	3	A	uh-huh.
3346	2	A	i, i thought it would be good, too,
3346	2	A	but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the peace corps
3346	6	B	yeah.
3346	7	A	because not all young people would have, uh, what it takes to go like that
3346	6	B	uh-huh.
3346	7	A	because i think it takes a certain person to, to be able to do something like that,
3346	2	A	but there's a lot of other public service things
3346	6	B	oh, sure.
3346	7	A	that could be done.
3346	6	B	oh, yeah,
3346	2	B	and, and even, even in our home towns there's a lot of
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	um, public service things that they could do
3346	6	A	right.
3346	7	B	uh, you know, drug rehabilitation  and
3346	6	A	right.
3346	7	B	and  alcohol and, and just, uh, helping old people, and, um, uh, you know, helping cripple, just helping somebody else
3346	6	A	yes,
3346	6	A	yeah.
3346	2	B	and i think that art of giving is something that, um, we don't have very much any more.
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	6	A	yeah,
3346	2	A	i think it would be that.
3346	13	A	when they say this proposal, is this something that they're just suggesting,
3346	13	A	or are they actually,
3346	20	A	why, why, why did they call it a proposal,
3346	5	A	that,
3346	4	B	oh, i think they just gave it a title
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	4	B	but is this not something that's, um, in legislation or
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	in work some --
3346	4	A	that's what i wondered.
3346	6	B	yeah,
3346	26	B	no, no,
3346	4	B	it's not,
3346	4	B	it's just a, just a topic,
3346	2	A	it'd be good character builder.
3346	3	B	i think so, too.
3346	3	B	i think so, too.
3346	2	B	um, because there's so many, um, kids who have, uh, you know, so much money and so much free time and, uh, nothing to do, um, and nothing to give their time to.
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	2	B	um, they don't even have a direction to give their, their time to,
3346	2	B	so i think
3346	6	A	right.
3346	7	B	it would be really good for people to, um, to be able to give their time in, in, uh, some kind of public service, uh, even in our government, you know, as, uh, aids to, uh, you know, congress, uh, people
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	5	B	so, um, yeah,
3346	2	B	it would be, it'd be really good
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	i think.
3346	4	A	well, people that are, um, have received sentences in jail, they have, uh, some of them are going out and doing, uh, they have to go out and do public service
3346	6	B	uh-huh.
3346	7	A	activities
3346	6	B	right.
3346	7	A	which to me is, is good.
3346	3	B	oh, yeah,
3346	3	B	oh yeah,
3346	2	B	i agree with you.
3346	2	B	this is something that, um, like you say, is it's character building
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	um, you know, learning how to, to give to others, and being less selfish
3346	5	B	and,
3346	2	A	well, i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like, you know,  what
3346	6	B	uh-huh.
3346	7	A	what  some of the other parts of the world are like or
3346	6	B	right.
3346	7	A	even other parts of the neighborhood
3346	6	B	uh-huh,
3346	6	B	uh-huh,
3346	6	B	yeah.
3346	7	A	some of the people, how they live
3346	5	A	or,
3346	3	B	oh, i agree with you,
3346	3	B	i agree with you,
3346	2	B	and i think, uh, young people are so, um, uh, focused just on themselves and their activities, and whose going out with whom, et cetera
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	that, uh, you know, to get a taste of what the real world is actually about
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	doing that public service would be great.
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	6	B	yeah.
3346	6	A	yeah,
3346	2	A	because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you, you can't tell them how things are
3346	6	B	right.
3346	2	A	they have to see for themselves
3346	6	B	uh-huh.
3346	2	A	now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,
3346	2	A	i don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.
3346	6	B	oh, yeah,
3346	2	B	i would think so, like right after, um, high school
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	you know, even if it was the, the, their, um, that summer right after high school
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	you know, # three months, #
3346	2	A	# of course # they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction
3346	6	B	uh-huh.
3346	7	A	you know, they, their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go
3346	6	B	uh-huh,
3346	6	B	uh-huh.
3346	7	A	and something,
3346	2	A	course now peace corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school
3346	6	B	right,
3346	6	B	right,
3346	7	A	so, - *should this be it's own slash unit?
3346	2	B	you know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	0	B	yeah,
3346	0	B	but, yeah,
3346	2	B	you know, right, right after you graduate from, um, high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, well gee whiz, what do i do now
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	if they're not focused on going to college,
3346	2	B	and, uh, you know, having that, that, uh, gung ho plan
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	7	B	uh, that's, you know, setting their life goals.
3346	2	A	kind of an in-between
3346	6	B	uh-huh.
3346	7	A	time.
3346	6	B	uh-huh,
3346	6	B	yeah,
3346	2	B	so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they graduated from high school.
3346	6	A	uh-huh.
3346	2	B	but as for its being required
3346	6	A	yeah.
3346	7	B	you know, we're just not, we're not based on, on that, uh
3346	6	A	huh-uh.
3346	7	B	type of a system. um.
3346	3	A	no,
3346	2	A	and like i said, not, now all young people should be able to do something,
3346	2	A	but
3346	6	B	uh-huh.
3346	7	A	not all certainly would be geared to, even the, the mormon boys that go out, not all of them go,
3346	2	A	i mean
3346	6	B	right.
3346	7	A	it's disaster if they don't go,
3346	2	A	but
3346	6	B	oh, right.
3346	7	A	but  some of them are not,
3346	2	A	they're just not made to do that type of thing
3346	6	B	uh-huh,
3346	6	B	uh-huh.
3346	2	A	and they just aren't able to do it.
3346	6	B	yeah,
3346	6	B	yeah,
3346	6	B	so, um, yeah,
3346	2	B	it'd be good
3346	2	B	but like i said, requiring it would be, uh,
3352	5	A	i've, uh,
3352	13	A	are you there?
3352	19	B	yes, sir,
3352	4	B	i'm right here.
3352	14	A	all right .
3352	5	A	okay, um,
3352	4	A	i'm in an area where, um, we can, uh, enjoy it year round,
3352	4	A	so, i've actually been, uh, uh, been out within the past couple of weeks.
3352	4	A	i'm mainly a freshwater fisherman.
3352	1	A	how about yourself?
3352	4	B	well, actually i've done both kinds
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	4	B	uh, i'm originally from the state of virginia
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	7	B	and, uh, lived near, near virginia beach where we could, uh, surf cast and, uh
3352	13	A	did you ev-,
3352	7	B	catch a lot of things in the ocean there.
3352	7	A	did you ever  do the james river?
3352	36	B	i don't believe i have fished the james river.
3352	4	B	there's a possibility, but that was so long ago
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	4	B	i moved here to, to state college, uh, in nineteen fifty-five
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	4	B	and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	4	B	and we have a lot of, uh, beautiful fresh water streams that come through thi-, this area.
3352	4	B	i'm in an area called center county, which is in the very center of the state of pennsylvania,
3352	4	A	i've i've been in that area
3352	4	A	and the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary.
3352	4	B	the trout fishing is really, uh, beautiful.
3352	4	B	as i say, the, the streams are, oh, eight, ten, fifteen feet wide and so forth,
3352	4	B	and, uh, you, you stand on the edge and you, you cast out and you, you work, uh, from your feet most of the time
3352	6	A	uh-huh,
3352	24	A	for brookies.
3352	4	B	and then there are, there are a few lakes of course, close
3352	5	B	by, *should this be part of utt1 and the end of a slash unit?
3352	6	A	yeah,
3352	13	A	what do you like, brookies or, uh, rainbows
3352	5	A	or,
3352	7	B	well, tell you the truth, i'm, i'm not, uh, not picky.
3352	5	B	i,
3352	5	B	wherever the area,
3352	4	B	whatever the fish is the specialist in that area, i, uh, i enjoy fishing for it,
3352	4	B	and i try to,
3352	4	B	i haven't fished in several years
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	7	B	i'll have to admit, but when i do fish, i do contact, uh, some of the local specialists
3352	6	A	yeah.
3352	7	B	so that i can then find out the, uh, the type of lures that they use and where they fish, and any unique, uh, techniques that would help you.
3352	13	A	do you fly fish, or are those streams too small?
3352	23	B	uh, no,
3352	23	B	we, we fly fish.
3352	6	A	yeah.
3352	6	B	uh-huh.
3352	4	A	i used to do that a little when i lived up in new york,
3352	4	A	but
3352	6	B	uh-huh.
3352	7	A	right now it's, uh, uh, bass and striped bass is the only thing that i go for down in dal-, in, uh, texas.
3352	2	B	oh, that's a pretty big fish.
3352	3	A	uh, yeah,
3352	5	A	they're, they've, uh,
3352	4	A	the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes,
3352	4	A	and they're pretty exciting when they're, when they're running.
3352	6	B	uh-huh.
3352	4	A	it's a salt water fish in fresh water, uh, environment.
3352	4	B	well, our, our streams here are replanted with fish about every year
3352	4	A	it's all put and take.
3352	7	B	so that, well, they, they, they, uh, they have a pretty good idea of, of, uh, what the number of fish are in these various locations,
3352	4	B	and --
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	7	B	and  they have have certain areas that they plant, you know, a hundred here and a hundred there,
3352	4	B	and this is, of course, x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens
3352	5	B	so,
3352	20	A	what's the season?
3352	13	A	april to sep-, october or something like that?
3352	23	B	that sounds about right
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	19	B	uh-huh,
3352	4	B	pretty close.
3352	5	A	uh
3352	5	B	you know.
3352	20	A	what's a license cost?
3352	4	B	well, as i say, it's been several years,
3352	4	B	but the licenses weren't that expensive,
3352	5	B	i,
3352	4	B	seems to stick in my mind, five to seven dollars
3352	6	A	yeah.
3352	7	B	is about all, from what i remember it.
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	4	A	it's about the same as texas.
3352	6	B	uh-huh.
3352	6	A	yeah.
3352	4	B	and i have, oh, probably a half a dozen different kinds of, uh, fishing poles and, and fly rods and so forth,
3352	4	B	and, and i had been so busy in my work in these last few years that i haven't had time to fish.
3352	4	B	but i'm going to be retiring at the end of december,
3352	4	B	and i, i hope, uh, the next fishing season, that i can sort of get back in and, uh, enjoy that.
3352	4	B	that, that was a really enjoyable, uh, thing for me to do.
3352	4	A	well, i have all sons, so i think i'm probably going to be fishing for a long time .
3352	4	B	huh, i just have one son and he, he lives out of the state now, rather, in the eastern corner of it,
3352	4	B	so, i don't think he has time to fish either .
3352	4	A	i caught the disease from my father,
3352	4	A	and i'm passing it on to my children.
3352	4	A	it's really ,
3352	18	B	oh, is that right?
3352	4	A	they love it,
3352	19	A	yeah.
3352	9	B	oh, my goodness.
3352	6	A	right.
3352	4	B	well, i, i, the disease i caught was simply because, uh, i, i was in the norfolk portsmouth area,
3352	5	B	and
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	7	B	people there,
3352	4	B	there's, there's so much water around
3352	6	A	right.
3352	7	B	that, you, you're either boating or you're fishing
3352	6	A	right.
3352	4	B	and, uh, i fairly enjoyed at that time.
3352	4	B	i have a small aluminum boat here
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	7	B	that, uh,
3352	4	B	when i go on one of the large lakes that we have here that i enjoy fishing for, for trout from that,
3352	4	A	uh, uh, i don't, i don't know about the lakes in central pennsylvania.
3352	13	A	are there many?
3352	4	B	well, as i say, i'm in center county.
3352	27	B	there's, um, there're two different size lakes about, well, five, six miles from state college.
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	2	B	now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	4	B	but they are probably fifteen, twenty acres maybe
3352	6	A	uh-huh.
3352	7	B	which, which here is a lot of water,
3354	0	A	okay,
3354	1	A	well what do you do on your yard?
3354	4	B	well, uh, typical lawn stuff.
3354	4	B	saint augustine, uh
3354	6	A	uh-huh.
3354	7	B	with a little bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas
3354	6	A	uh-huh.
3354	4	B	uh, and really all i do to it is,
3354	4	B	uh, in fact, i didn't even fertilize it this year,
3354	4	B	i just mowed it,
3354	4	B	and i, i mow it, uh, you know, with a mulch mower so the, the particles fall down
3354	13	A	comes back in the yard
3354	19	B	yeah.
3354	13	A	so you don't have any one do your yard.
3354	13	A	you do it yourself?
3354	23	B	i do it myself.
3354	6	A	yeah,
3354	4	A	we do too.
3354	4	B	have a lot of people trying to do it for me .
3354	9	A	isn't that the truth.
3354	2	A	a flyer's on every door every day.
3354	4	B	hey, i need the exercise,
3354	8	B	so what the heck.
3354	3	A	that's right.
3354	4	A	well, we, um, we, my husband does the same thing,
3354	4	A	he does the yard,
3354	4	A	and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower,
3354	4	A	but i keep putting off learning.
3354	2	B	hey, you've got the right idea.
3354	3	A	that's right.
3354	4	A	but i had recently gone out and planted mums.
3354	4	A	we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago,
3354	4	A	and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at calloway's
3354	6	B	uh-huh.
3354	4	A	and put out yellow and bronze
3354	4	A	and they're just gorgeous, and so then last week my mom comes in town,
3354	4	A	and she says well, those are going to die just the first frost.
3354	16	B	<Laughter>.
3354	4	A	she said, you should have done pansies.
3354	4	A	and i went, well, now you tell me.
3354	6	B	yeah .
3354	4	A	so the first night, that around halloween
3354	4	A	and we went out and covered them with a sheet,
3354	4	A	and they did okay that first night.
3354	4	A	but the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it,
3354	4	A	so i guess i've lost them.
3354	4	A	i haven't gone out to check yet.
3354	6	B	yeah,
3354	9	B	i don't blame you.
3354	4	B	i wouldn't want to look at them.
3354	3	A	no,
3354	11	A	listen,
3354	4	A	but, um, the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here.
3354	4	A	i guess it was about four years ago.
3354	4	A	and we did not know in august to put down the, uh, whatever it is for grub worms.
3354	6	B	uh-huh.
3354	4	A	and the next spring, i guess in that march, every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed, we'd have big whole patches come up.
3354	13	A	have you ever seen it
3354	19	B	yeah.
3354	7	A	what grub worms do?
3354	19	B	yeah.
3354	4	A	and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it,
3354	4	A	it would just come off in the rake, down to the dirt.
3354	4	A	so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything.
3354	4	A	it took a lot of money and a lot of time,
3354	4	A	so the most careful thing we do on our yard every august is put down that diazinon.
3354	6	B	yeah,
3354	13	B	you, you think that's what it was, huh.
3354	19	A	oh, yeah,
3354	4	A	we found them
3354	14	B	okay.
3354	6	A	yeah
3354	4	A	we found them.
3354	4	A	we dug under there about an inch
3354	4	A	and you could see them.
3354	4	A	they're real fat little white things,
3354	4	A	and
3354	6	B	yeah.
3354	7	A	they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
3354	3	B	yeah,
3354	4	B	those kind of brown, uh,  ju-,
3354	3	A	yeah,
3354	5	A	but in, but in the,
3354	7	B	what we call june bugs
3354	6	A	uh-huh.
3354	4	B	and some people call them may beetles.
3354	3	A	yeah,
3354	4	A	june bugs is what i'd heard them called,
3354	16	B	<Laughter>.
3354	4	A	so any how, occasionally i find them in the flower beds.
3354	4	A	they said that every yard has some
3354	6	B	uh, yeah.
3354	4	A	but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem.
3354	4	A	so that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before.
3354	6	B	yeah,
3354	4	B	well, i had some of that problem,
3354	4	B	but mine was freeze.
3354	3	A	oh, yeah
3354	3	A	that too,
3354	13	A	two years ago, or last christmas
3354	19	B	yeah,
3354	19	B	yeah.
3354	7	A	is that what you're talking about?
3354	19	B	yeah,
3354	4	B	i'm still --
3354	6	A	yeah,
3354	6	A	uh-huh.
3354	7	B	i'm still  replacing that in the back, especially, under the trees
3354	6	A	uh-huh.
3354	7	B	uh, you know, kind of slow, and, as you say, very expensive.
3354	6	A	yeah.
3354	4	B	i caught wolfe with, uh, uh, one, uh, one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents,
3354	4	B	and, uh
3354	6	A	oh, yeah.
3354	7	B	i bought about twenty of them.
3354	4	A	i guess you did too.
3354	4	A	it's what they've done in the spring
3354	5	B	uh, well, i put, you know --
3354	7	A	or the fall.
3354	2	B	that was late,
3354	5	B	that was like,
3354	3	A	yeah,
3354	4	A	because i started to say, you can, there's different times they say it's okay to do it.
3354	3	B	yeah,
3354	4	B	that was like september, i think.
3354	6	A	yeah.
3354	4	B	and i had to water it, you know
3354	6	A	yeah
3354	9	B	gosh.
3354	6	A	keep it damp.
3354	5	A	well, my,
3354	4	A	out here, you know, we don't have as many trees in plano,
3354	4	A	at least the area where,
3354	4	A	we're over by collin creek mall,
3354	4	A	and, but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front, like the pittosporum all died,
3354	4	A	and all those variegated, uh, things died.
3354	4	A	so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly,
3354	4	A	and they just live,
3354	3	B	yeah,
3354	2	B	they're pretty tough, uh,
3354	3	A	yeah,
3354	2	A	you can, you can stand those.
3354	4	B	pittosporum is kind of borderline here
3354	6	A	uh-huh.
3354	4	B	and usually it'll do pretty well,
3354	4	B	but, uh, you know, every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals
3354	6	A	yeah.
3354	4	B	and it zaps it.
3354	5	A	well it's kind of like one of these,
3354	2	B	oh, wax leaf, wax leaf ligustrum is the same way.
3354	3	A	same way,
3354	3	A	uh-huh.
3354	4	A	that, they, they warned me of that one finally.
3354	4	A	and i said, you know, you need to either read neal sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery, because lot of places that would, are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there,
3354	4	A	and we didn't know the difference.
3354	4	A	and every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before. like about these mums.
3354	6	B	yeah.
3354	6	A	okay,
3354	4	A	next year, i'll do pansies.
3354	2	B	your list is growing,
3354	4	A	and my backyard, we had it really nice,
3354	4	A	and then my husband wanted a labrador puppy,
3354	5	A	and so, it was about,
3354	4	A	i guess he's three now,
3354	4	A	so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants
3354	6	B	oh, yeah,
3354	9	B	oh, gee.
3354	7	A	and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio.
3354	6	B	um.
3354	5	A	so, it's like our backyard is just kind of like,
3354	4	A	as long as he won't damage it, fine,
3354	4	A	and if he'll, if there's anything he'll hurt, we just don't put it out there any more.
3354	6	B	yeah,
3354	2	B	kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds,
3354	5	B	yeah.
3354	3	A	uh-huh.
3354	3	A	very much,
3354	5	A	but, uh.
3354	4	B	i had a, had a small vegetable garden that, uh,
3354	6	A	you did.
3354	4	B	it did pretty well,
3354	4	B	it's, it's like on  the
3354	6	A	huh.
3354	7	B	side,  the apron of the, of the  parkway out behind the garage
3354	6	A	uh-huh.
3354	4	B	and, uh, our, our garages come in from the back, you know, from the alley
3354	4	A	so do ours,
3354	5	A	yeah.
3354	4	B	and, uh, it's, it's a little piece of land over there .
3354	20	A	what did you grow?
3354	4	B	well, i had, uh, tomatoes and, and, uh, uh, peppers,
3354	4	B	and  i had,
3354	9	A	that is amazing.
3354	7	B	i had  okra,
3354	4	B	and by the fence i had cucumbers, which, which didn't do real well, uh
3354	6	A	yeah.
3354	4	B	they kind of came out looking like gourds.
3354	11	A	well, put them in a salad, though,
3354	11	A	and you say, well, i made it though, at least it's mine.
3354	4	B	but i had squash,
3354	4	B	i had zucchini and, and yellow crook neck squash,
3382	4	A	uh, i guess, uh, i've always been kind of interested in, in, space and stuff.
3382	4	A	i've,
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	7	A	read a lot of  the,
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	7	A	the,  uh, astronomy books  and,
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	7	A	and  stuff like that. uh,
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	13	B	have you been following the, uh, the progress of the space health code ?
3382	23	A	uh, to a degree.
3382	4	A	i haven't kept up as, uh, much as i would like,
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	4	A	i've just been so busy, uh,
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	4	A	i barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then,
3382	5	A	so.
3382	6	B	yeah.
3382	2	B	i think it's pretty exciting that they can, uh,
3382	2	B	it would be interesting to see if they can find, uh, other planets that are, that will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans
3382	5	B	and, uh, yeah,
3382	4	B	i think i would be very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it is at all possible.
3382	6	A	yeah.
3382	4	A	well, i wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one,
3382	16	B	<Laughter>.
3382	5	A	or right now
3382	2	A	but i'm probably getting a little too old for that.
3382	2	B	well, i know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.
3382	3	A	right.
3382	3	A	yeah.
3382	2	A	well, they, they just made leaps and jumps.
3382	2	A	i think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that,
3382	3	B	yeah,
3382	3	B	i agree. uh,
3382	4	B	as a matter of fact we're the ones that i have been to houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there,
3382	4	B	and, uh, one of the big advances that we use every day now is velcro
3382	6	A	uh-huh.
3382	4	B	and, uh, that vacuum , uh, little space program was one of the big, you know, backers of that.
3382	6	A	yeah.
3382	2	B	it's amazing, you know,
3382	5	B	you,
3382	2	B	it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now.
3382	6	A	yeah.
3382	16	B	<Laughter>.
3382	13	A	i don't know if you ever watch gallagher , you know,
3382	4	A	he's one of the comedians
3382	4	A	and --
3382	19	B	uh-huh,
3382	19	B	yeah,
3382	4	B	i've h-, seen him before.
3382	7	A	and,  you know, he, he talks a lot on, on velcro.
3382	16	B	<Laughter>.
3382	8	A	wh-,  i-, what  would we do without it? .
3382	6	B	yeah.
3382	4	B	yo-, we were talking about that just the other day.
3382	8	B	what did we do without it back then?
3382	6	A	yeah.
3382	2	B	i guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.
3382	6	A	yeah.
3382	16	B	<Laughter>.
3382	6	A	yeah,
3382	2	A	there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that have come up .
3382	5	A	i know maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh,
3382	4	A	concentrated foods for one maybe
3382	28	A	i don-,
3382	3	B	that's right.
3382	3	B	that's right.
3382	7	A	uh, i don't  know
3382	8	A	it's also just i've, i've often pictured, uh, in my mind, you know, what it would be like to just, what would you find if you just kept on going, kept on going?
3382	3	B	uh-huh.
3382	3	B	that's true.
3382	2	A	uh, i guess our minds are so, uh, uh, what is it? uh, finite
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	2	A	when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object,
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	7	A	and it's hard to, to see, you know.
3382	6	B	yeah.
3382	4	A	i always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually.
3382	16	B	<Laughter>.
3382	2	A	it's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.
3382	3	B	yeah,
3382	3	B	that, that is, uh, that is something that would be hard to think about.
3382	3	B	i agree.
3382	3	B	you know like you say we're used to finite things
3382	2	B	and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible.
3382	3	A	yeah.
3382	5	A	but,
3382	6	B	but, uh, yeah,
3382	4	B	i would like to see them, uh, do more in that area to make space travel more, uh, something that the ordinary person can, uh, en-, enjoy.
3382	3	A	yeah.
3382	2	A	i know it's i think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something.
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	4	A	and i, i'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you know,
3382	6	B	yeah.
3382	6	B	yeah,
3382	4	B	me too.
3382	4	B	i wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.
3382	6	A	yeah.
3382	2	B	i think, uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't,
3382	6	A	huh.
3382	7	B	or experience something, you know, indifferent.
3382	2	A	i think that's what made us, uh, progress to the state we are is our curiosity.
3382	3	B	oh, sure.
3382	3	B	sure.
3382	3	B	of course.
3382	3	B	that's true.
3382	2	A	there must be some better so-, better way of doing this.
3382	2	A	a better place to be or whatever, you know
3382	5	A	it's,
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	2	A	so you, you are always looking for something better.
3382	3	B	yeah,
3382	3	B	that's true.
3382	4	A	i know at work, uh, people always complain to me
3382	4	A	i, well, you are always whining
3382	4	A	and,
3382	16	B	<Laughter>.
3382	7	A	it's, i'm always looking for something better. uh,
3382	6	B	yeah .
3382	2	A	there's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it.
3382	3	B	that's right.
3382	3	B	that's right.
3382	2	B	and if you are just content with being, you know, with the way things are then, you know, then you must lead, lead a pretty dull life.
3382	6	A	yeah.
3382	5	B	because if yo-,
3382	2	A	well, they are always finding easier ways
3382	2	A	and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that.
3382	6	B	uh-huh.
3382	2	A	and they are doing it un-, you know, unconsciously.
3382	3	B	yeah,
3382	2	B	i guess, uh, you don't really think about it too much.
3382	2	B	i guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff
3382	5	B	but yo-,
3382	2	B	it, it's in a subconscious, you know, thing.
3382	2	B	you know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon,
3382	2	B	you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list.
3382	6	A	uh-huh.
3382	2	B	but you just don't think about them.
3382	6	A	right.
3382	3	B	and that's true.
3382	5	B	i think, uh, you know,
3382	4	B	we've gotten different programs at work, you know, to, to, uh, make it visible to management that we are doing things better,
3433	0	A	okay.
3433	20	A	what do you think of the public school system?
3433	13	A	first off, do you have children that are in it?
3433	23	B	i have children that are in the plano public school systems
3433	4	B	and i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school,
3433	14	A	# oh, okay . #
3433	7	B	# system .
3433	5	B	so, #
3433	2	A	well then, you should be a good one to know because i, my children are grown now.
3433	4	A	i now have grandchildren,
3433	6	B	# oh. #
3433	7	A	# in the # school system
3433	4	A	so, uh, i don't have firsthand experience right now,
3433	6	B	# uh-huh,
3433	6	B	uh-huh. #
3433	7	A	# with it. #
3433	1	A	so what do you think?
3433	2	B	well, i think the public school systems are doing a good job.
3433	2	B	i think they have a long way to go yet
3433	2	B	but i think that, um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier.
3433	4	B	you know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers,
3433	2	B	and i think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done.
3433	2	B	and i think that, uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, you know, skills.
3433	0	B	you know,
3433	6	A	# right. #
3433	7	B	# you don't # just add one plus one
3433	2	B	you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together.
3433	2	B	and i think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think,
3433	2	B	they literally cannot come in out of the rain.
3433	3	A	that's right .
3433	5	B	you know, and that just,
3433	2	B	i don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted.
3433	6	A	# right. #
3433	4	B	# and, uh, # this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education.
3433	2	B	so i think, you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have,
3433	2	B	and i think that's very, very important.
3433	3	A	yes,
3433	3	A	it is.
3433	2	A	i, i agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren,
3433	4	A	we have a, uh, fourth grader
3433	4	A	and then we have one that's in kindergarten
3433	4	A	and, and i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing, were doing in the fifth and sixth grade.
3433	6	B	oh, yeah.
3433	4	A	you know, it's amazing,
3433	16	B	<Sniffing>.
3433	7	A	to me and stuff that i didn't do until i was in junior high.
3433	6	B	# oh, yeah. #
3433	7	A	# which, of course, shows # my age.
3433	4	B	i tutor a girl that's in eighth grade
3433	4	B	and her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my algebra two,
3433	16	A	<Laughter>.
3433	7	B	when i was in high school.
3433	13	A	# is that scary?
3433	16	A	. #
3433	4	B	# and it's like, oh, i going to take this home and study it # before i can help you.
3433	6	A	# right. #
3433	4	B	# you know, # so they're really, they're really moving them along
3433	4	B	but yet, at the same time, you know, they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life.
3433	5	A	# now, #
3433	5	B	# and # that's wha-, you know,
3433	4	B	a lot of the things that we did in school i've never used and never will use.
3433	6	A	yes.
3433	2	B	and, uh, so i think that it's, it's appropriate to teach them, you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this.
3433	3	A	correct.
3433	13	A	are you finding that, uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time?
3433	4	A	um, i have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms.
3433	19	B	yes,
3433	5	B	# that's a, #
3433	5	A	# and, and # d-,
3433	13	A	are you, do you find that?
3433	4	B	well, filling out the forms and also all of these, uh, statewide and national wide testing,
3433	6	A	# uh-huh. #
3433	7	B	# things # so that they compare
3433	2	B	and . you know, you can as far as i'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say.
3433	6	A	uh-huh.
3433	4	B	and it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it.
3433	2	B	and you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be,
3433	5	A	# be,
3433	6	A	uh-huh. #
3433	7	B	# you know, # that i think it's, uh, i think it's crazy personally
3433	16	B	.
3433	16	A	<Laughter>.
3433	4	B	you know, the fir-, the whole first nine weeks of school is, is used as a review
3433	4	B	but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in,
3433	24	A	# coming up,
3433	6	A	uh-huh. #
3433	7	B	# october. # so that you know, your school district shines throughout the united states.
3433	2	B	and i think that's totally useless.
3433	2	B	i think, you know, there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons
3433	2	B	but i think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous.
3433	2	B	it's like bragging on your grandchildren.
3433	6	A	right .
3433	2	B	you know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth
3433	2	B	and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this,
3433	4	B	and that's great.
3433	2	B	but that's what they're doing with the school systems
3433	2	B	and they're wasting too much time on that, # i think. #
3433	4	A	# well, i, # i know that this again this, this friend,
3433	16	B	<Sniffing>.
3433	7	A	uh, is in the plano school district,
3433	6	B	# uh-huh. #
3433	4	A	# and # she teaches, uh, uh, it mus-, uh, emotionally disturbed children.
3433	6	B	# uh-huh. #
3433	4	A	# and she says # she has, um, six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade.
3433	6	B	yes.
3433	0	A	and,
3433	16	B	<Sniffing>.
3433	7	A	she says she's getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them on even though they're not ready.
3433	2	A	but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something.
3433	28	A	i didn't quite understand it.
3433	6	B	yeah,
3433	5	B	there's a,
3433	5	B	yeah.
3433	5	A	# and, uh, #
3433	2	B	# the bottom # line is always money,
3445	0	A	all right.
3445	2	A	i think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight.
3445	24	B	which is movies,
3445	41	B	correct?
3445	23	A	that is correct.
3445	14	B	# okay. #
3445	13	A	# are you # a movie buff?
3445	19	B	um, yeah.
3445	4	B	i don't like going to see them in the theaters
3445	4	B	but outside of that, rent a lot,
3445	4	B	watch them on t v mostly.
3445	4	A	well, i have a v c r
3445	4	A	and i see most all of mine there.
3445	20	A	what have you seen recently that you enjoyed?
3445	21	B	uh, i don't know, um,
3445	4	B	actually earlier tonight we were watching to live and die in l a.
3445	13	B	have you seen that movie?
3445	26	A	no,
3445	4	A	i haven't.
3445	2	B	it's a kind of one of those psycho ones.
3445	4	A	now, i, i live alone.
3445	4	A	consequently, i don't like these sa-, psycho things.
3445	2	B	oh, it's not too bad.
3445	4	B	one of those cop thrillers
3445	5	B	but,
3445	6	A	oh, okay.
3445	13	A	have you seen the mov-,
3445	5	A	if,
3445	13	A	do you have a v c r?
3445	19	B	yes,
3445	4	B	we do.
3445	13	A	have you seen the movie class action with gene hackman?
3445	26	B	uh, no,
3445	4	B	i haven't yet.
3445	4	A	i saw it this weekend
3445	2	A	and it is, uh, to me an outstanding movie.
3445	4	A	i thoroughly enjoyed it.
3445	4	A	he is, uh, an attorney and his daughter is an attorney
3445	4	A	and she has a suit against his company.
3445	4	A	you know, it's one of those things.
3445	6	B	# yeah,
3445	5	B	that, #
3445	5	A	# but # there's a lot of l-,
3445	2	A	well, it's just it's something that anyone can watch and enjoy.
3445	2	B	he's a good actor though.
3445	32	A	beg your pardon?
3445	2	B	um, gene hackman's a good actor.
3445	3	A	yes,
3445	2	A	# he is. #
3445	7	B	# i think. #
3445	13	B	do you see hoosiers?
3445	19	A	yes.
3445	4	A	i've seen hoosiers.
3445	4	A	saw it just again the other night, # for, #
3445	6	B	# yeah, #
3445	4	B	actually i, we saw her just the other night too.
3445	18	A	oh, did you?
3445	19	B	yeah.
3445	4	B	it's one of our favorite movies.
3445	4	B	i, i live with, um, a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us.
3445	4	B	we've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months.
3445	13	A	have you seen the movie, um, crossing delancy?
3445	19	B	yeah.
3445	4	A	now, that's one i have watched, oh, six or eight times.
3445	4	A	i always feel so good when i get through with that movie.
3445	6	B	yeah,
3445	4	B	i like those movies that you watch time and time again.
3445	4	A	i do too.
3445	4	A	dirty dancing and crossing delancy are two of my favorite.
3445	20	A	so, well what business are you in?
3445	4	B	i'm, i'm an electrical engineer.
3445	6	A	oh.
3445	13	A	in new hampshire.
3445	14	A	# all right. #
3445	4	B	# i work # in massachusetts actually.
3445	14	A	oh, all right.
3445	6	A	okay.
3445	13	A	so is everything going all right up there?
3445	4	B	um, it's only about, um, half an hour.
3445	4	B	i live wi-, on the border.
3445	2	A	oh, well that's that bad then.
3445	4	A	half an hour, we do that just going to downtown dallas.
3445	3	B	that's right.
3445	5	A	so,
3445	4	B	see we live up in tax free new hampshire and drive down to massachusetts to work.
3445	2	A	that makes a lot of sense .
3445	16	B	<Laughter>.
3445	5	A	but, um, we,
3445	13	A	are you a native of that part of the country?
3445	19	B	yeah,
3445	4	B	i grew up in new hampshire.
3445	4	B	it seems, southern town,
3445	4	B	it's called portsmouth.
3445	4	B	it's, i don't know, fifteen minutes from the mass-, border and five minutes from the main border. /*main = maine?
3445	4	B	we live right in the corner.
3445	6	A	oh.
3445	4	B	that one little spot in new hampshire, we have ten miles of coastline,
3445	4	B	i live on one of tho-, that little ten mile spot.
3445	9	A	uh, sounds wonderful.
3445	13	A	did you have damage this year with hurricanes?
3445	36	B	not up, um, where i live
3445	4	B	but further down the coast in massachusetts they got hit pretty bad.
3445	4	A	i happened to be in nassau
3445	4	A	and we got the backlash of that thing.
3445	4	A	and they had record high waves, thirty year high waves come in there,
3445	4	A	and it was quite an experience
3445	5	A	so.
3445	20	A	well, what movies are you looking forward to seeing now?
3445	21	B	um, well, i'm, i'm only twenty-seven years old
3445	4	B	so the doors movie, that's out on video. i want to watch that.
3445	14	A	okay.
3445	13	A	# have you seen green card? #
3445	2	B	# that would be pretty good. #
3445	26	B	no,
3445	4	B	i haven't seen that one.
3445	2	A	that's a real warm movie.
3445	2	A	it, it really just turned out nicely.
3445	4	A	so i would recommend that if you have a chance.
3445	4	B	i'm in for it.
3445	4	B	we rent a lot of movies
3445	4	B	so we, we often sit around and say, what movies should we rent?
3445	16	A	<Laughter>.
3445	4	B	and we # don't know. #
3445	11	A	# well if you, # if you can get green card, go for it.
3445	3	B	all right,
3445	4	B	we'll try that one.
3445	4	A	i have been working at, uh, as an accountant at the medical school here in dallas
3445	4	A	and i have watched, uh, gross anatomy.
3445	13	A	have you seen that one?
3445	19	B	yeah,
3445	4	B	i did.
3445	14	A	okay.
3445	28	A	and i don't know
3445	4	A	i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students i see over at the medical school.
3445	4	A	but i hope you have a very merry christmas.
3445	4	B	you too.
3445	4	A	i'm looking forward to it.
3445	2	B	i think we're going to have a white christmas up here just like the song says.
3445	5	A	well,
3491	21	B	well, let me see,
3491	20	B	what have you seen lately?
3491	4	A	well, uh, city slickers, and star trek five.
3491	13	B	five?
3491	19	A	yeah ,
3491	19	A	yeah.
3491	5	B	y-,
3491	13	B	only, only five?
3491	19	A	yeah.
3491	16	B	<Laughter>.
3491	4	A	i thought i'd better see that one before i go and see six.
3491	31	B	well, no,
3491	2	B	didn't need to.
3491	3	A	no,
3491	4	A	i found that out .
3491	16	B	<Laughter>.
3491	1	A	how about yourself?
3491	4	B	i just saw the latest one.
3491	20	A	how is it?
3491	4	B	it was fantastic.
3491	4	A	oh, i can't wait.
3491	6	B	yeah,
3491	5	B	it's,
3491	4	B	the lines in there were just perfect.
3491	4	B	i mean, it was classic trek.
3491	13	A	now, does the old star trek guys meet the new guys?
3491	26	B	no,
3491	26	B	huh-uh.
3491	6	A	no,
3491	13	A	it's just the old guys still.
3491	19	B	yeah,
3491	2	B	it was just a rumor that that would happen this time.
3491	2	B	however, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time
3491	5	B	so,
3491	4	A	you know, that i read in people or somewhere, no, it was u s a today
3491	6	B	uh-huh.
3491	4	A	that they said they weren't going to do anymore.
3491	4	A	that was it.
3491	6	B	uh-huh.
3491	5	A	but,
3491	6	B	yeah,
3491	2	B	uh, except that the rumor is, is that they still might,
3491	2	B	but it may not include the entire crew
3491	2	B	and it will be a next generation meets this generation .
3491	6	A	huh.
3491	5	B	so,
3491	34	A	i'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was.
3491	4	B	i think it's a hundred years.
3491	6	A	huh.
3491	4	B	somewhere in that range.
3491	4	B	considering that spock was on an, uh, you know, couple weeks ago
3491	3	A	oh, that's right.
3491	7	B	and that the, the very first episode of next generation, they had mccoy.
3491	18	A	is that right?
3491	13	A	he was
3491	5	B	and,
3491	7	A	a doctor
3491	19	B	uh-huh.
3491	7	A	still?
3491	19	B	yeah,
3491	4	B	well, you know, he was rear admiral, whatever, you know,
3491	4	B	and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow.
3491	2	B	vulcans age a lot better .
3491	3	A	well, yeah,
3491	13	A	he didn't look too bad, did he?
3491	26	B	no,
3491	26	B	huh-uh.
3491	4	B	matter of fact, he looks just as about as old and the, uh, next generation as he does in the latest star trek .
3491	9	B	imagine that.
3491	6	A	yeah,
3491	9	A	that's amazing.
3491	16	B	<Laughter>.
3491	13	A	but, did they have some pretty good special effects?
3491	23	B	oh, excellent, excellent special effects.
3491	2	B	but i think the script was, you know, just incredible compared to the last one.
3491	3	A	yeah,
3491	2	A	five was, the script was bad, bad, bad .
3491	8	B	well, you know why?
3491	26	A	no,
3491	4	A	i don't.
3491	20	A	why?
3491	4	B	uh, william shatner wrote it.
3491	18	A	oh, is that right?
3491	4	B	and even worse, he directed it.
3491	6	A	uh,
3491	16	B	<Laughter>.
3491	2	A	l-, leonard, s-, nimoy, he does a lot better.
3491	3	B	oh, yeah,
3491	4	B	he, in fact, uh, he didn't direct this one.
3491	4	B	he produced this one .
3491	4	B	but he directed the one before, uh, i think star trek four, something like that.
3491	4	A	in search of spock, or, no, journey home, i think that was.
3491	3	B	yeah,
3491	3	B	uh-huh.
3491	13	A	are, you're a real life trekkie?
3491	5	B	l-,
3491	23	B	i think so .
3491	4	A	i really like them.
3491	4	A	i, i wouldn't go so far as being a trekkie,
3491	5	A	but --
3491	6	B	uh-huh.
3491	6	A	uh,
3491	4	B	well, i've gone to, you know, one for real live trek convention
3491	5	B	but,
3491	18	A	oh, really?
3491	19	B	yeah,
3491	4	B	i saw james doohan, you know, the guy that plays, uh, scotty.
3491	13	A	huh, did you get to talk to him?
3491	26	B	no .
3491	4	A	it was
3491	13	B	not in a crowd like that.
3491	7	A	crowded.
3491	6	B	huh-uh.
3491	26	A	no.
3491	4	B	it was like, uh, want an autograph, want to stand in line for about four hours.
3491	6	A	yeah.
3491	16	B	<Laughter>.
3491	9	A	wow.
3491	4	B	it was a pretty crowded place.
3491	4	A	huh. they have some good management principals in this new generation.
3491	6	B	oh, yeah,
3491	6	B	yeah,
3491	5	B	i,
3491	4	B	it's, it's kind of funny.
3491	4	B	i, uh, was reading in, uh, a book. uh, trying to think,
3491	4	B	i can't quite remember the name of the book,
3491	4	B	but it was, it was saying don't do star trek management style.
3491	4	B	and they were referring to, you know, captain kirk,
3491	4	B	every time he left the enterprise, everything went to hell.
3491	6	A	oh.
3491	4	B	and nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship .
3491	6	A	right,
3491	13	A	so he kind of was a cowboy type, too.
3491	19	B	uh-huh
3491	13	A	made all the decisions
3491	2	A	but, uh, jean luke does more of a, a,
3491	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
3491	7	A	committee type of management.
3491	3	B	uh-huh,
3491	3	B	yeah,
3491	2	B	uh, it's definitely a lot better . a lot more realistic really.
3491	20	A	what other movies have you seen?
3491	4	B	uh, saw the addams family last week.
3491	20	A	oh, how was that?
3491	4	B	it was pretty good.
3491	4	B	uh, there were a few things different than the old series,
3491	4	B	but on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. and, a lot of fun.
3491	13	A	lots of little funny spots, huh.
3491	19	B	oh, yeah,
3491	19	B	yeah.
3491	13	A	did they have thing
3491	5	A	and,
3491	19	B	oh, yes,
3491	4	B	in fact, thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series.
3491	4	B	i mean, you know, there is lots of areas where thing saves the day.
3491	18	A	really?
3491	4	B	and he runs around a lot.
3491	5	A	how did,
3491	34	A	i've always wondered how he gets around.
3491	4	B	uh, you know, just finger hopping.
3491	13	A	but he's in a box, right?
3491	26	B	no,
3491	26	B	no,
3491	26	B	no,
3491	4	B	in fact, it's funny.
3491	4	B	he never did, does come in out of a box, i don't think.
3491	5	B	yeah,
3491	4	B	he was just kind of walking around.
3491	13	A	didn't he used to?
3491	36	B	not really.
3491	4	B	he was always
3491	14	A	oh.
3491	7	B	in the box before.
3491	14	A	oh, that's, yeah, that's, okay.
3491	6	B	yeah.
3491	30	A	yeah,
3491	4	A	that's what i was thinking.
3497	20	A	so, how is the weather out there?
3497	4	B	uh, it's really cold
3497	4	B	and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold
3497	4	B	and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had.
3497	18	A	oh, really?
3497	4	B	you have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff.
3497	20	B	how about you guys?
3497	4	A	um. uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same.
3497	4	A	the usual, i think.
3497	6	B	oh.
3497	4	A	so, nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff .
3497	4	A	it's good.
3497	6	B	yeah,
3497	4	B	well the weather, let's see, well, the snow here is different from utah's,
3497	4	B	because i have lived in utah for like ten years.
3497	18	A	oh, really?
3497	20	A	what part?
3497	5	B	and, uh,
3497	4	B	provo.
3497	4	B	i was going to b y u.
3497	18	A	oh, really?
3497	14	A	okay.
3497	3	B	yeah.
3497	4	B	and, uh, the snow is like, really cold.
3497	4	B	i mean, it's, like, really humid
3497	4	B	so it seems wetter or something like that.
3497	5	B	it's,
3497	13	A	it's more humid in utah than there?
3497	19	B	uh-huh.
3497	15	A	or there?
3497	4	B	it's more humid in iowa
3497	14	A	okay.
3497	7	B	than utah.
3497	3	A	right.
3497	6	B	yeah.
3497	14	A	okay.
3497	4	B	and it seems like when the winds blow, it's really, it goes right through you.
3497	4	B	it's really different from utah's weather.
3497	4	B	i thought utah was cold,
3497	4	B	but i think iowa is a lot colder .
3497	3	A	yeah,
3497	4	A	see, that's how it is in texas, too
3497	4	A	because when it's cold, it's really cold.
3497	5	A	so,
3497	6	B	yeah,
3497	2	B	i don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind .
3497	32	A	what's that?
3497	4	B	i don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind.
3497	6	A	right.
3497	6	A	yeah.
3497	2	A	so the humidity is i think what does it .
3497	3	B	yeah,
3497	3	B	i think that's true.
3497	5	A	because i, i noticed when i got here, too,
3497	5	A	because like i'd,
3497	4	A	when it would snow in texas
3497	6	B	uh-huh.
3497	7	A	uh, i would just, i mean we'd be f-, really cold
3497	4	A	and we'd have to get really warm,
3497	4	A	and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing
3497	4	A	and  you don't --
3497	3	B	yeah,
3497	3	B	yeah,
3497	3	B	that's true.
3497	7	A	you don't  feel super cold.
3497	2	A	it was weird.
3497	6	B	yeah.
3497	20	A	but, so how long ago did you graduate?
3497	15	A	or did you,
3497	5	A	or,
3497	4	B	uh, i graduated in nineteen eighty-seven.
3497	18	A	oh, really?
3497	19	B	yeah,
3497	4	B	my husband got his doctorate at b y u,
3497	5	B	so that's,
3497	4	B	and so he just graduated this past year.
3497	6	A	oh.
3497	13	A	so you just barely moved away?
3497	19	B	uh-huh .
3497	19	B	yeah,
3497	4	B	we really miss, *slash error?
3497	13	A	do you like it out there?
3497	7	B	well, we really miss  utah .
3497	4	B	we miss
3497	13	A	you do?
3497	7	B	the mountains.
3497	6	A	yeah.
3497	4	B	because it's, like, really flat here .
3497	4	B	well, not flat, but hilly.
3497	4	B	but no big mountains or anything.
3497	6	A	uh-huh.
3497	13	A	so you just moved away a year ago?
3497	23	B	uh, in august.
3497	9	A	wow, really recent.
3497	3	B	yeah.
3497	22	B	but, uh, see, see what else can i say about the weather.
3497	4	B	uh, , well, today was warmer .
3497	4	B	it was like forty-five .
3497	9	A	oh, warm .
3497	20	B	so, what's the temperature up today over there?
3497	9	A	oh, man,
3497	4	A	it's got to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe.
3497	18	B	oh, really?
3497	27	A	maybe not that warm.
3497	5	A	probably about, uh,
3497	5	A	yeah.
3497	4	A	it's not, it's not that cold, really.
3497	4	B	and whenever i remembered the weather reports in utah, i never really remember them talking too much about wind chill.
3497	6	A	yeah.
3497	4	B	but they talk about wind chill here all the time.
3497	3	A	yeah,
3497	4	A	that's a big deal in texas, too.
3497	4	B	they said it could be, like, six degrees out and, like, negative forty-one wind chill.
3497	6	A	um.
3497	4	B	so, that's what we're not used to .
3497	3	A	yeah,
3497	3	A	that's true.
3497	2	A	that makes a big difference. huh.
3497	5	B	so, oh, i,
3497	13	A	so, did you used to ski when you were out here?
3497	32	B	what's that?
3497	13	A	did you used to ski when you were in utah?
3497	27	B	oh, i've only, i've only skied in utah once.
3497	18	A	oh, really?
3497	4	B	i only skied once my whole life .
3497	16	A	<Laughter>.
3497	13	B	but, do you do a lot of skiing there?
3497	36	A	uh, not tons,
3497	4	A	but i like to when i get a chance.
3497	6	B	uh-huh.
3497	4	A	i've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since then.
3497	4	A	just saving my money for christmas things
3497	6	B	yeah.
3497	7	A	and that.
3497	13	B	so is this your first year in utah?
3497	26	A	uh, no,
3497	4	A	this is actually my third year.
3497	13	B	and you're going to school there?
3497	19	A	uh-huh.
3497	6	B	oh.
3497	19	A	yep.
3497	13	B	at u of u,
3497	5	B	or,
3497	26	A	no,
3497	4	A	at b y u.
3497	18	B	oh, really?
3497	19	A	yeah.
3497	6	B	oh.
3497	4	A	so, but, i'll be here a long time , at this rate.
3497	20	B	what's your major?
3497	4	A	uh, it was nursing,
3497	4	A	but i'm in the process of changing it right now.
3497	6	B	uh-huh,
3497	6	B	oh.
3497	4	A	because it's really, really competitive at b y u.
3497	6	B	yeah.
3497	4	A	you have to have like a three seven to get in
3497	5	A	so,
3497	3	B	that's true.
3497	7	A	it's really,
3497	4	A	i'm going to look into some other fields.
3497	5	A	i'd like,
3497	4	A	all the science classes and that, i'm just not really enjoying too much
3497	4	A	so
3497	6	B	uh-huh.
3497	7	A	i think i better get into something that i can enjoy the process of going to school
3497	5	A	so,
3497	6	B	yeah,
3497	9	B	that's, that's a good idea.
3497	13	A	did you graduate in a certain field
3497	13	A	or,
3497	4	B	uh, education.
3497	4	B	i got a double major.
3497	20	A	in,
3497	4	B	uh, elementary and special ed.
3497	13	A	really?
3497	19	B	uh-huh.
3497	4	A	that what my sister did.
3497	18	B	oh, really?
3497	19	A	yeah,
3497	2	A	you might know her.
3497	4	A	here name is lori, bird.
3497	28	A	maybe not .
3497	4	A	i think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably,
3497	5	A	but, she got her doc-,
3497	6	B	yeah,
3497	39	B	well, i can't,
3497	4	B	there are so many girls in all my classes,
3497	4	B	i can't remember
3497	6	A	yeah,
3497	6	A	yeah.
3497	7	B	how many people.
3497	4	A	because they, since, uh, stopped that program. i mean,  where you can --
3497	18	B	oh, have they?
3497	7	A	where you can  get it double pretty easily.
3497	6	B	oh.
3497	4	A	i mean, it's, it's really,
3500	2	A	in, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot, i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem.
3500	41	B	do you?
3500	20	B	why?
3500	20	A	why?
3500	2	A	well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away.
3500	13	B	you think the problem is not enough doctors?
3500	23	A	i think the problem is that the doctor v-, doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your h-, uh,  unemp-, i mean, on your  liability.
3500	9	B	gosh,
3500	4	B	i really have a different point of view on this .
3500	18	A	oh?
3500	7	B	well, because i'm a nurse
3500	6	A	uh-huh.
3500	7	B	for one thing.
3500	13	A	and you think there are plenty of doctors?
3500	19	B	oh, yeah,
3500	4	B	i don't think there is a shortage of doctors
3500	4	B	and i do know that o b, which is my field
3500	6	A	uh-huh.
3500	7	B	the doctors' health in-, the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year
3500	9	A	it's astronomical.
3500	7	B	that deliver babies.
3500	2	B	now they can't doing anything about that.
3500	2	B	i don't think they're in a conspiracy.
3500	2	B	i think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them.
3500	31	A	no,
3500	2	A	people don't sue
3500	2	B	people are very sue, sue conscious.
3500	2	A	lawyers sue.
3500	2	A	if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor
3500	6	B	yeah.
3500	7	A	they wouldn't sue a one of them.
3500	3	B	well, that's probably true, too.
3500	7	A	you know.
3500	2	B	but people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days.
3500	9	A	well, sure.
3500	5	B	and, so,
3500	2	A	but, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory.
3500	13	A	you know what tort theory is?
3500	26	B	no.
3500	4	A	well, a tort is when you do something wrong.
3500	6	B	right.
3500	5	A	well, it, uh,
3500	2	A	an o b g y n doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent.
3500	3	B	that's right.
3500	2	A	if the baby is born dead, well, that happens.
3500	5	B	well,
3500	2	A	if, if they have complications and,
3500	17	B	it depends.
3500	4	A	well, i know, i mean, there are guys that are real slobs,
3500	4	A	but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job.
3500	4	A	and the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else.
3500	3	B	well, that's true,
3500	2	B	they are
3500	7	A	you know,
3500	7	B	because doctors are performing many more tests.
3500	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
3500	2	B	many of them are unnecessary,
3500	4	B	they are doing so many c sections
3500	2	A	just to prevent a
3500	7	B	just to
3500	7	A	a law suit.
3500	7	B	prevent.
3500	4	B	because they have all these monitors now
3500	2	B	and if anything looks even a little bit funny
3500	6	A	yeah.
3500	7	B	their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby,
3500	2	B	c and
3500	6	A	yeah.
3500	7	B	so  it's costing more all around in health insurance
3500	6	A	uh-huh.
3500	7	B	for tests, for surgery, for longer hospital stay.
3500	4	A	see, i believe
3500	4	B	so, it's terrible.
3500	7	A	that there, there is a system already in place for health care.
3500	6	B	uh-huh.
3500	2	A	you know, they have indigent health care.
3500	4	A	you show up at parkland bleeding
3500	24	B	you'll get it.
3500	4	A	and they'll fix you.
3500	3	B	that's true.
3500	7	A	you know.
3500	4	B	in fact, you'll get it at presbyterian if you show up there, too.
3500	6	A	yeah.
3500	4	B	and we have that happen.
3500	4	B	we have patients that go through parkland
3500	6	A	uh-huh.
3500	7	B	through the clinic
3500	4	B	and at the last minute, they come to us.
3500	4	B	well
3500	6	A	uh-huh
3500	16	A	<<faint>>.
3500	7	B	uh, we can't turn them away.
3500	5	B	so,
3500	6	A	yeah,
3500	2	A	i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation
3500	6	B	yeah.
3500	7	A	the problem would pretty much evaporate.
3500	3	B	i'm for that.
3500	4	B	i've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer,
3500	4	B	so
3500	6	A	yeah.
3500	7	B	i'd like to wipe them all out .
3500	4	A	well, i, i happen to know a few
3500	4	A	and i even claim one as a friend.
3500	16	B	<Laughter>.
3500	4	A	he's a divorce attorney.
3500	16	B	<Laughter>.
3500	5	A	but,
3500	4	B	he better not be mine .
3500	2	A	i think he'll go nameless for the, for the purposes of this conversation.
3500	4	A	but i also know an, uh, o b g y n who has stopped practicing.
3500	6	B	yeah,
3500	2	B	some they do.
3500	4	A	uh, he just said,
3500	4	B	they stop their o b at least.
3500	6	A	yeah,
3500	4	A	i mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies
3500	6	B	right,
3500	7	A	ever.
3500	6	B	right.
3500	4	A	his malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year.
3500	9	B	that's incredible.
3500	4	A	and, you know, he said, i had to, he had to ear-, gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice.
3500	6	B	yeah.
3500	2	B	and most of them are very sincere.
3500	2	B	most of them do the
3500	6	A	yeah
3500	16	A	<<faint>>.
3500	7	B	best they can.
3500	4	B	they are human.
3500	4	A	this,
3500	4	B	occasionally
3500	7	A	this  guy is catholic.
3500	7	B	something will go wrong.
3500	7	A	yeah,
3500	0	A	i mean, you know,
3500	2	B	well, you can be human and catholic.
3500	7	A	yeah,
3500	3	A	i know you can be human and catholic,
3500	16	B	<Laughter>.
3500	2	A	but, you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, you know, have a less conscientious effort.
3500	6	B	yeah,
3500	26	B	no
3500	5	A	i mean,
3500	2	B	most of them do.
3500	4	B	i really believe that.
3500	2	B	from dealing with doctors, dealing with lawyers, there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious.
3500	20	A	well, you know, who is getting rich?
3500	2	A	insurance companies.
3500	3	B	yeah,
3500	3	B	they are.
3500	2	A	you know, if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance,
3500	4	A	say, say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed
3500	5	A	or,
3506	13	B	now is it stacy?
3506	4	A	angie.
3506	30	B	angie,
3506	10	B	i'm sorry.
3506	40	A	okay.
3506	20	B	well, now, so if you were going to have a dinner party, what would you make?
3506	21	A	um, let's see,
3506	4	A	uh, i like seafood.
3506	21	A	uh, let's see,
3506	4	A	uh, shrimp, steamed she-, uh, shellfish with maybe herbs.
3506	4	A	uh, spicy lobster with lem-, linguini.
3506	2	B	that sounds good.
3506	6	A	yeah.
3506	32	B	now what is, uh, what is, uh, the steamed shellfish you said?
3506	19	A	uh-huh.
3506	13	B	and what would that be like, a clam or, uh,
3506	23	A	right.
3506	14	B	okay.
3506	6	A	yeah.
3506	2	A	uh, i think hors d'oeuvres are good, too.
3506	4	A	uh, and that way, you can have a variety. uh,
3506	20	B	so if you have a, a dinner party and you're going to serve, uh, seafood for supper, what type of, uh, hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal?
3506	5	A	uh,
3506	15	B	like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or,
3506	6	A	yeah,
3506	2	A	fresh vegetables would be good
3506	5	A	or, uh, just,
3506	13	B	probably not nachos and dip, huh?
3506	26	A	no.
3506	13	B	and would you, uh, would it be appropriate to, uh, drink with the, uh, prior, when you have the hors d'oeuvres?
3506	19	A	yeah,
3506	19	A	yeah.
3506	14	B	okay.
3506	20	B	and then when you serve the meal, what type of wine would you have with, uh, with the, with seafood?
3506	21	A	oh, all these hard questions .
3506	16	B	<Laughter>.
3506	13	A	uh, what, white wine?
3506	23	B	that would be my guess.
3506	6	A	yeah.
3506	4	B	and,
3506	4	A	i'm not really a drinker,
3506	4	A	so i'm not, i don't know a lot about that.
3506	7	B	and then,  uh, uh, dessert.
3506	13	B	something sweet?
3506	9	A	oh, goodness.
3506	4	A	uh, chocolate, something chocolate.
3506	5	A	uh ,
3506	13	B	you must like chocolate.
3506	19	A	yes.
3506	21	B	well, let's see.
3506	4	B	usually when we have a dinner party, i always, i like to grill.
3506	13	A	oh, you do?
3506	4	B	so, we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese.
3506	4	B	one of our favorites is, uh, to take some, let's see philadelphia cream cheese i think, a is that what comes in
3506	6	A	# uh-huh. #
3506	7	B	# those little blocks?  #
3506	6	A	yeah.
3506	7	B	and pour cocktail sauce over the top of it and then get these little canned shrimp and, uh, wash them and cool them and then dump them in the, uh, sauce and then take crackers
3506	4	B	and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese
3506	2	B	and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail.
3506	4	B	and then i like to barbecue, like steaks or pork chops.
3506	4	B	and then we have, uh, s-, oh, lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them
3506	6	A	uh-huh.
3506	7	B	and a salad
3506	4	B	and then, uh, i don't know what we usually have for dessert.
3506	4	B	cake sometimes,
3506	4	B	but, uh, that's what we would do for a dinner party, i guess.
3506	2	A	that sounds good, too.
3506	2	B	but that's, i guess when you talk about dinner party, that's probably not, uh, that's more for like when friends come
3506	4	A	traditional
3506	7	B	over.
3506	41	A	right?
3506	4	B	traditional,
3506	19	B	yeah.
3506	6	A	yeah.
3506	2	B	i wouldn't be the big, uh, snotty kind.
3506	4	A	i just started,
3506	16	B	<Laughter>.
3506	7	A	i just really started,  uh, uh, learning about that
3506	4	A	and i bought a martha stewart,
3506	13	A	i don't know if you've heard of her.
3506	26	B	huh-uh.
3506	4	A	her cookbook
3506	4	A	and she talks about catering and, uh, you know, goes into, goes into all that and the different types of, uh, uh, different types of parties, you know, different types of foods.
3506	13	B	oh, well, do you work in a, uh, in a setting where you, uh, are in the food business?
3506	4	A	um, my father owns a restaurant.
3506	13	B	oh,  in,  uh,
3506	4	A	it's, it's just a, uh, c-, a cafe,
3506	4	A	so it's not really anything, you know, that i want to,
3506	4	A	it's not the same .
3506	7	B	is it in  dallas?
3506	4	A	uh, it's in lewisville.
3506	14	B	okay,
3506	14	B	all right.
3506	20	B	so you graduated from which high school?
3506	4	A	trinity.
3506	30	B	trinity,
3506	14	B	okay.
3506	13	B	and that's a public school or private?
3506	4	A	that's public.
3506	14	B	huh, okay,
3506	4	B	i have to get to know this area a little better, i guess.
3506	13	B	uh, well, is your father's cafe, uh, one that you could cater out of?
3506	26	A	no,
3506	26	A	uh-huh, /*listen; mistranscription of 'uh-uh'?
3506	4	A	it's not.
3506	13	B	um, and he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably.
3506	16	A	<Laughter>.
3506	16	B	<Laughter>.
3506	5	A	uh.
3506	21	B	well, let's see,
3506	21	B	what else for catering. uh,
3506	22	A	let's see,
3506	20	A	what about hawaiian luau.
3506	2	B	oh, that would be good.
3506	4	A	could have, uh, uh, fruits and, and pineapple, uh,
3506	21	A	let's see, uh,
3506	2	B	and you could actually go with, uh, a chicken if you wanted to.
3506	2	A	i think, i think decorating your food is, you know, really,
3509	1	A	so, how do you feel about capital punishment?
3509	4	B	well, i, i'm not really certain how i, uh, i'm not certain that, that it does a lot of good. i mean, that it ends up, ends up effectively, uh, uh, uh, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital  punishment --
3509	6	A	right,
3509	5	A	# you don't think, #
3509	7	B	# penalties. #
3509	28	B	yet, on the other hand, uh, i don't know,
3509	5	B	i mean, there is things that
3509	2	B	seems like it's, it's, it's the right thing to do.
3509	2	B	now, you know, i mean somebody, a  s-, s-, serial killer or somebody  goes in and machine guns, you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard,
3509	5	B	you kind of,
3509	28	B	i don't know.
3509	1	B	what about yourself?
3509	4	A	i, uh, i have the same dilemma, i think. uh,
3509	2	A	it's, you know, it seems right sometimes
3509	2	A	and then other times, you don't know.
3509	6	B	uh-huh.
3509	6	A	uh,
3509	5	B	i mean, people, like,
3509	5	B	i,
3509	5	B	it's been,
3509	2	B	i mean, like the arab societies and stuff end up, uh, having e-, effective, effective punishments
3509	2	B	and, and they're extremely severe.
3509	2	B	uh, i, you know, i think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, uh, may be because y-, you never know if it's going to be a-, applied. right,
3509	2	B	un-, unlike, uh, like in, in arab societies. if you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand
3509	2	B	and --
3509	6	A	# right. #
3509	7	B	# and  you walk around # the rest of your life with one hand
3509	2	B	and everybody knows exactly what, what for.
3509	6	A	# right. #
3509	2	B	# uh, # and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact,
3509	2	B	or, or there is a good chance you're going to get off.
3509	3	A	uh-huh.
3509	2	A	and also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm,
3509	2	A	i mean, sure, their life is taken,
3509	2	A	but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway,
3509	2	A	so
3509	6	B	uh-huh.
3509	7	A	i think sometimes they'd prefer just to get it over with
3509	2	A	so it's more of the easy way out than
3509	7	B	yeah,
3509	5	B	some people,
3509	7	A	making them pay  for the con-, for  the --
3509	6	B	yeah.
3509	7	A	you know, what they've done.
3509	2	B	except that, i mean, the, the average cost to si-, to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high. i mean, something, i, i was amazed at. uh, uh, per year,
3509	4	B	it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year.
3509	6	A	yeah.
3509	7	B	to keep people in jail.
3509	2	B	uh, you know, and it's sort of a , sort of a crass perspective
3509	6	A	uh-huh.
3509	7	B	on the usage of capital punishment,
3509	4	B	but on the other hand, uh, uh, you know, i don't, i don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, uh ...
3509	3	A	right,
3509	4	A	but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway,
3509	5	A	so
3509	6	B	uh-huh .
3509	7	A	uh, it's,
3509	5	A	it doesn't,
3509	5	A	it seems by, that by,
3509	28	A	i don't know,
3509	5	A	doesn't ever really, p-, uh ...
3509	3	B	oh, i know,
3509	5	B	i mean, you can't,
3509	2	B	it doesn't,
3509	6	A	# yeah. #
3509	7	B	# taking # , taking one more life doesn't, doesn't, doesn't  re-, # get things back the way they were, right. #
3509	3	A	# right.
3509	3	A	it doesn't bring back every, #
3509	6	B	yeah,
3509	28	B	i don't know,  i, i don't,  i really don't know, uh,
3509	20	A	what state are you in?
3509	4	B	i'm in texas.
3509	18	A	oh, really?
3509	5	B	w-, w-,
3509	13	A	in dallas?
3509	26	B	no,
3509	4	B	i'm in austin.
3509	18	A	oh, really?
3509	20	B	where, where are you calling from?
3509	4	A	uh, right now i'm in utah,
3509	4	A	but i'm from plano, texas.
3509	14	B	oh, i see,
3509	5	B	uh-huh.
3509	20	A	so, uh, uh, what are the laws like in texas?
3509	5	B	it's, texas is, has, is one of the, one of the s-, well,
3509	4	B	i guess there is more and more states that are, that are going back to capital punishment.
3509	4	B	uh, texas has had it for a while.
3509	4	B	it's one of the quickest,
3509	5	B	it, it,
3509	4	B	once it was, it was reallowed,
3509	4	B	i think it was outlawed for a while, but, uh, by the supreme court, i mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution
3509	4	B	and it seems like everybody stopped
3509	4	B	and then, and then once they sort of reallowed it, texas was one of the first to, uh, to actually, uh, implement it again.
3509	18	A	oh, really?
3509	4	B	they do it by, uh, by, do it by lethal injection.
3509	6	A	uh-huh.
3509	4	B	uh, i'm originally from kansas
3509	4	B	and in kansas also, uh, they, they almost immediately put back capital punishment
3509	4	B	and, uh, there they do it by hanging.
3509	9	A	wow.
3509	5	B	still, uh, they have,
3509	4	B	i still remember the, the, the movie, uh, in cold blood.
3509	13	B	i don't know if you've ever,
3509	13	B	i'm sure you're familiar with it,
3509	13	B	but, have you seen the movie?
3509	36	A	i haven't,
3509	26	A	no.
3509	6	B	yeah.
3509	4	B	that way.
3509	13	A	and they do it that way?
3509	19	B	yeah,
3509	4	B	well, they, they show it,
3509	5	B	not, not,
3509	4	B	i mean, the, the movie was made in, like, nineteen sixty-two or something like that
3509	6	A	huh.
3509	4	B	and so it's, uh, it's not particularly graphic,
3509	4	B	but on the other hand it's, it's fairly impressive to watch them, you know, walk into the room with gallows.
3509	4	B	it's kind of a barn like structure.
3509	9	A	wow.
3509	4	A	i think they're there,
3509	4	A	i think that capital punishment is, is, uh, in t-, in utah also.
3509	4	A	i'm not really familiar.
3509	18	B	is that right?
3509	13	B	are you there in school?
3509	19	A	yeah,
3509	4	A	# i am. #
3509	6	B	# yeah. #
3509	5	A	so, but i think they d-,
3509	4	A	a long time ago, i, i remember my dad was telling me this, i think, that, uh, they do it by, like, a bunch of men have guns
3509	4	A	and one of them has the real gun in it.
3509	6	B	# uh-huh,
3509	5	B	has, has a,
3509	5	B	yeah. #
3509	4	A	# so they don't know who killed, #
3509	13	B	has a real bullets
3509	13	B	and the rest of them have blanks?
3509	23	A	right.
3509	6	B	yeah,
3509	4	B	i, i certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner,
3509	3	B	i know that .
3509	6	A	yeah,
3509	3	A	no.
3509	4	B	i've always said that if i, if i had to kill and clean and do my own, my own meat, i think i'd become a vegetarian.
3509	3	A	. i know.
3509	2	B	as long as you're sort of safely removed from it, it seems, seems not so, so bad, i guess.
3554	4	A	of a exercise program you have.
3554	4	B	well, um, i have a, a, a former exercise program.
3554	4	B	i'm a graduate student,
3554	4	B	and this semester, i'll tell you what, i, it's been almost impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise.
3554	7	A	right.
3554	4	B	um, last summer i was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard,
3554	4	B	so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming
3554	4	B	and, um, and since i worked at a recreation center i could, uh, you know, use those facilities quite often.
3554	6	B	but, um.
3554	2	A	well, swimming is, uh, one of the best exercises you can do.
3554	6	B	oh, yeah.
3554	7	A	i mean
3554	6	B	oh, yeah.
3554	7	A	as far as for, uh, cardiovascular
3554	4	A	and --
3554	6	B	uh-huh,
3554	4	B	and there's --
3554	7	A	and  it's
3554	7	B	and there's  no jarring on the.
3554	7	A	least hard on your body,
3554	5	A	i,
3554	32	B	pardon?
3554	4	A	it's the least hard on your body
3554	3	B	exactly, yeah,
3554	5	B	um, flu-, --
3554	7	A	as far as, uh, impact
3554	5	A	and
3554	6	B	yeah,
3554	29	B	fluid resistance.
3554	3	A	right,
3554	3	A	right.
3554	6	B	uh-huh,
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	1	B	how about you?
3554	4	A	well, i do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week,
3554	5	A	but it's not enough to,
3554	4	A	boy if i go, in the summer time i try to jog, jog a couple of miles
3554	6	B	oh, yeah.
3554	4	A	and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out  and --
3554	6	B	yeah.
3554	7	A	and  go jogging for, uh
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	7	A	half hour or so,
3554	4	A	but --
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	7	A	so,  i'm not quite getting the level that i need to.
3554	6	B	yeah.
3554	13	B	do you, do you kind of think it's a chore,
3554	15	B	or do you enjoy it?
3554	23	A	i like it.
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	4	A	i like it, uh,
3554	4	A	part of my problem is i have small children,
3554	4	A	so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	7	A	scheduling and
3554	6	B	sure,
3554	5	B	yeah.
3554	7	A	that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
3554	4	A	when you're in college, boy.
3554	16	B	<Laughter>.
3554	7	A	you got a hundred things going on.
3554	2	A	of course, you got a little different direction going,
3554	5	A	but, uh.
3554	6	B	uh-huh,
3554	5	B	yeah.
3554	4	B	uh, i, um, i used to, uh, i used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds,
3554	4	B	and now i weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. um,
3554	4	B	so i drastically had to change the way i ate when i, when i first moved to college,
3554	4	B	and, uh, i had started weight lifting quite regularly,
3554	4	B	and so i got my weight down,
3554	4	B	and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when i'm not fat like i used to be
3554	6	A	# right,
3554	24	A	you don't notice it #
3554	7	B	# i don't worry about it #
3554	5	B	, yeah.
3554	7	A	as much,
3554	5	A	yeah.
3554	3	B	uh-huh.
3554	4	B	although lately i have noticed, you know, even if i gain, like two pounds, i start, i start feeling it
3554	5	B	and,
3554	13	A	you feel it, don't you?
3554	19	B	uh-huh.
3554	4	A	it's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes,
3554	4	A	and i weigh probably about the same i weighed for, oh, i don't know how many years,
3554	4	A	but, uh, it's changed places .
3554	16	B	<Laughter>.
3554	4	A	and things don't fit just quite exactly
3554	6	B	yeah.
3554	7	A	fit the same.
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	13	A	but, uh, so, do you do, uh,
3554	5	A	in texas, uh, does
3554	13	A	there, probably quite a few facilities.
3554	19	B	yeah,
3554	4	B	there are.
3554	4	B	um, i'm living in a dorm right now,
3554	4	B	and so right downstairs there's a facility.
3554	4	B	and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there
3554	0	B	and.
3554	13	A	do you enjoy it,
3554	15	A	or is it, uh.
3554	7	B	i really do if i have the time to.
3554	24	A	if you can have, find the time
3554	6	B	uh-huh
3554	7	A	it's just the.
3554	3	B	yeah,
3554	4	B	i really do, because i like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while,
3554	4	B	but that's hard, you know.
3554	6	A	yeah,
3554	4	A	it is hard
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	4	A	it is hard.
3554	2	A	it's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	7	A	sacrifice another half hour.
3554	4	A	my problem is i don't want to wake up another half hour earlier
3554	3	B	exactly.
3554	7	A	and do more .
3554	16	B	<Laughter>.
3554	4	A	don't get enough sleep as it is,
3554	41	A	right
3554	19	B	uh-huh,
3554	19	B	yeah,
3554	19	B	yeah.
3554	5	A	and, uh, kind of have,
3554	2	A	if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of,
3554	2	A	course it's really, you know,
3554	2	A	as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
3554	6	B	oh, yeah.
3554	2	A	you feel invigorated
3554	2	A	and  you feel
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	7	A	oh, you feel  in a lot better shape
3554	6	B	yeah,
3554	24	B	ready to go another twelve hours.
3554	7	A	just like eating right foods.
3554	6	B	yeah,
3554	6	B	yeah.
3554	4	A	if i eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	13	B	do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?
3554	23	A	i do.
3554	4	A	i have to be real careful.
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	4	B	i stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
3554	41	A	did you?
3554	19	B	uh-huh,
3554	4	B	completely.
3554	4	B	i mean, any kind of meat
3554	4	B	or, and i, and i really feel a lot better now.
3554	13	A	makes a lot of difference.
3554	19	B	yeah,
3554	4	B	it really does.
3554	4	A	well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
3554	6	B	uh-huh,
3554	5	B	yeah,
3554	4	B	that's it, i mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
3554	6	A	right.
3554	4	B	and so. i found that really helps.
3554	4	A	and unless you really like, uh, fish.
3554	16	B	.
3554	4	A	fish is pretty good for you,
3554	5	A	but, uh.
3554	6	B	yeah,
3554	4	B	i eat that,
3554	4	B	i think i've eaten fish like twice since.
3554	4	B	i used to eat a lot of fish, too,
3554	4	B	but i just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.
3554	24	A	kind of see what happens.
3554	3	B	yeah,
3554	4	B	and i like it.
3554	4	A	i've tried to do that with sugar
3554	0	A	and,
3554	16	B	<Laughter>.
3554	7	A	it's almost impossible
3554	4	B	# i don't know if i'm that brave yet # .
3554	2	A	# everything has sugar in it # .
3554	16	B	<Laughter>.
3554	2	A	i mean, if you go,
3554	4	A	your ketchup has sugar in it.
3554	6	B	uh-huh,
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	5	A	course,
3554	4	A	and i like sugar, too,
3554	4	A	that's --
3554	6	B	uh-huh.
3554	7	A	that's  a problem,
3554	5	A	but.
3554	16	B	<Laughter>.
3554	12	A	anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you.
3554	12	A	think we've, uh, covered all the subject.
3554	12	B	okay,
3554	12	B	yeah,
3554	12	B	it sounds good.
3554	12	A	okay.
3554	12	B	well, good luck to you there in idaho.
3554	12	A	well, you, too.
3554	12	A	good luck, uh,
3554	12	A	enjoy college while you can.
3554	12	A	let me tell you it's, uh.
3554	12	B	well, i'm in graduate school now.
3554	12	B	i, i, i kind of feel like i wish i could have gone back to undergraduate now .
3554	12	A	it's a little different, uh
3554	12	B	yeah.
3554	7	A	challenge, isn't it?
3554	12	B	yeah,
3554	12	B	it is.
3554	12	B	well, it's good talking,
3554	12	A	where are you  going
3554	12	B	pardon?
3554	7	A	studying?
3554	12	B	i'm studying speech pathology.
3554	12	A	right.
3576	21	B	let's see, / *something missing? a.1?
3576	4	B	my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,
3576	4	B	but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying
3576	6	A	uh-huh.
3576	7	B	and, um, taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,
3576	4	B	i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for halloween and christmas,
3576	4	B	but basically he does all the heavy stuff,
3576	4	B	and i do all the fun stuff .
3576	4	A	well, we have it just opposite here.
3576	4	A	my wife works  in, you know, at,  at, at the t i,
3576	4	A	and she's, uh, sedentary all day long
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	7	A	so when she gets home she likes to mow.
3576	6	B	i see.
3576	4	A	and we have about ten acres,
3576	4	A	and she tries
3576	9	B	wow.
3576	7	A	to mow about half of it .
3576	9	B	wow. that's a, a big job.
3576	3	A	well, yeah,
3576	5	A	it keeps, uh, well,
3576	4	A	it's doing real well,
3576	4	A	because when we got this place the, the dirt was just overgrazed
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	i mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	and now, you know, since we've been mowing it,
3576	4	A	and, you know, of course we water a little bit,
3576	4	A	that's just too much to water all at once,
3576	4	A	but --
3576	9	B	oh, sure.
3576	7	A	but  just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.
3576	9	B	oh, i bet it's beautiful.
3576	3	A	yeah,
3576	4	A	but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers.
3576	4	A	we have one little flower garden
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	7	A	that we, that we work with.
3576	4	A	the rest of it is just like wild flowers
3576	30	B	wild flowers.
3576	4	A	and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	they're about, oh, i guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	and
3576	9	B	oh, that sounds lovely.
3576	7	A	course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush.
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	2	B	oh, the wild flowers are beautiful.
3576	4	B	i think, um, i was thinking about throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets
3576	4	B	or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty.
3576	13	B	then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved.
3576	19	A	yeah.
3576	4	A	well, my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing.
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	uh, she enjoys mowing.
3576	4	A	i can't believe it.
3576	6	B	uh-huh,
3576	4	B	# i know a lot of # --
3576	4	A	# i mean, i hate it # .
3576	6	B	uh-huh,
3576	4	B	a lot of women do. um,
3576	4	B	i've just never really, you know,
3576	4	B	maybe one of these days i'll have to get out there and mow,
3576	4	B	but, um, my husband takes it on,
3576	4	B	and i'll help rake up the grass,
3576	4	B	and, um, sometimes i'll help him edge, um,
3576	4	B	because, we don't have that much property,
3576	4	B	but we're on a corner lot,
3576	4	B	so there's a lot of edging to do
3576	6	A	right.
3576	2	B	and, um, uh, that's what's nice about living more in the country,
3576	2	B	you don't have to worry about any of that .
3576	4	A	we don't even have any concrete
3576	6	B	oh.
3576	7	A	or asphalt.
3576	9	B	oh, that's nice,
3576	5	B	i,
3576	4	B	this is different for us because the other,
3576	4	B	in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks,
3576	4	B	and, um, it's been a little more country with the trees,
3576	4	B	and we do miss that.
3576	4	B	um, if we had a chance to move, i think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified
3576	6	A	uh-huh.
3576	7	B	and a little less maintenance required
3576	6	A	yeah
3576	7	B	as, as far as that goes.
3576	4	A	but, you know, we do everything together.
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	this, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the,
3576	4	A	actually this fall, i was talking about,
3576	4	A	two weeks ago
3576	6	B	oh.
3576	7	A	we got a thousand pine trees from the, you know, soil and conservation people
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	and, uh, we're in the process of, of planting
3576	9	B	wow that's,
3576	4	A	and we're building a stand, uh, just to the north of our house, and along the east, uh, property line
3576	6	B	um.
3576	4	A	and i, uh, i think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	7	A	because i tell you, in the winter time when that, when that wind comes out of the north, it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.
3576	6	B	right.
3576	5	A	so.
3576	6	B	right.
3576	5	B	# well, i put, #
3576	4	A	# on the # other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the delicate flowers and the mums,
3576	4	A	and we have morning glory
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers,
3576	4	A	and we planted those out by the septic, so that, uh, they get plenty of water
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	and we get hummingbirds come in the
3576	6	B	oh.
3576	7	A	spring, you know, all summer long.
3576	9	B	oh, that sounds so pretty.
3576	4	A	and, well, when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.
3576	9	B	oh really .
3576	16	A	<Laughter>.
3576	13	B	do they, don't do any damage, though,
3576	13	B	they just fly right back out, if you have the,
3576	19	A	well, yeah,
3576	4	A	they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat
3576	9	B	i see.
3576	4	A	and when you're as busy as one of those babies, you've got to eat most of the time.
3576	6	B	i see.
3576	4	A	and we got a few, you know,
3576	4	A	we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	but, you know, for the most part, gardening for us is,
3576	4	A	well, we got asparagus,
3576	4	A	and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	7	A	and some blackberries and strawberries.
3576	4	A	man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe.
3576	9	B	oh, oh, that sounds wonderful.
3576	4	A	we just got our last tomatoes.
3576	9	B	oh, i love home gro-, grown tomatos.
3576	3	A	yeah.
3576	2	B	there's nothing like them.
3576	2	B	they just don't have the same ones in the supermarket .
3576	4	A	well, these are accidental tomatos.
3576	20	B	what does that mean, accidental tomatoes?
3576	4	A	well, last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes,
3576	4	A	of course you're going to lose some that way
3576	6	B	uh-huh.
3576	4	A	and the seeds go right through them.
3576	6	B	i see.
3576	4	A	and wherever they pooped,
3584	11	A	well, tell me about your home.
3584	3	B	okay.
3584	4	B	uh, right now we're living in,
3584	4	B	well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys.
3584	4	B	and, uh, right now we're in a, uh, i guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home.
3584	6	A	uh-huh.
3584	7	B	which you might call it.
3584	4	B	so we don't have a, a big yard. uh,
3584	4	B	but, uh, when my wife and i first moved in, it was just the two of us.
3584	4	B	so it was enough.
3584	6	A	uh-huh.
3584	4	B	uh, and it's, uh, i guess what they call a story and a half.
3584	4	B	because it's not a full two story.
3584	6	A	yeah.
3584	7	B	where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.
3584	4	B	so, it's got real high ceilings on half the house
3584	4	B	and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
3584	6	A	huh.
3584	4	B	and, uh, it's about a five year old house now.
3584	9	A	it sounds nice.
3584	3	B	it's, uh, pretty nice.
3584	4	B	unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already .
3584	18	A	oh, yeah?
3584	19	B	yeah.
3584	5	B	it was a,
3584	4	B	landmark is the one who built it.
3584	6	A	yeah.
3584	2	A	well, you know, these guys that gambled high
3584	6	B	yeah.
3584	7	A	lost big you know.
3584	3	B	that's true.
3584	4	A	and, uh
3584	3	B	exactly what happened to them.
3584	7	A	i'm insulating myself from that problem.
3584	4	A	i'm building my own house.
3584	9	B	oh, that's nice.
3584	4	A	and as i look out the window of my trailer, i can envision all the insulation that's going up today .
3584	18	B	oh, really.
3584	19	A	yeah.
3584	13	B	are you doing it yourself?
3584	19	A	yeah.
3584	9	B	wow.
3584	4	A	i used to be a builder.
3584	9	B	oh, that's nice.
3584	4	A	and i retired about five years ago # and #
3584	6	B	# oh, i # see.
3584	7	A	started college.
3584	6	B	huh.
3584	4	A	and now i'm a college educated builder # .
3584	2	A	there's still no work, you know. #
3584	6	B	# # # yeah. #
3584	4	A	# so, uh, # you know, i decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials
3584	4	A	so i did.
3584	9	B	that's great.
3584	4	A	and, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
3584	5	B	r-,
3584	18	B	is that so?
3584	4	B	# i didn't know that. #
3584	4	A	# you can borrow the # money to pay somebody else to build your house
3584	4	A	but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
3584	9	B	well that sounds kind of dumb.
3584	4	A	well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
3584	6	B	uh-huh.
3584	4	A	and then it doesn't sell
3584	4	A	and then the # bank's #
3584	6	B	# yeah. #
3584	7	A	holding the bag.
3584	6	B	yeah.
3584	5	A	well.
3584	6	B	huh.
3584	2	A	as, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to # costs three times as much. right? #
3584	3	B	# # that's right .
3584	2	A	hence the savings and loan problem we have.
3584	3	B	yeah,
3584	3	B	that's true.
3584	4	A	but, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple.
3584	4	A	it's designed to be added on to.
3584	6	B	uh-huh.
3584	9	B	that's good.
3584	6	A	yeah.
3584	4	A	well, i figure it's just me and my wife
3584	4	A	but, you know, i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,
3584	4	A	so # i want #
3584	6	B	# yeah. #
3584	7	A	to have a shop.
3584	20	B	how big a lot do you got it on?
3584	4	A	ten acres.
3584	9	B	wow.
3584	9	B	that's nice.
3584	9	B	that's real nice.
3584	3	A	well, yeah.
3584	4	A	it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor.
3584	4	A	he's on the other side of a hill.
3584	6	B	oh.
3584	4	A	and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon.
3584	16	B	<Laughter>.
3584	4	A	seriously.
3584	9	B	god.
3584	9	B	that's pretty good.
3584	4	A	well, in the winter time, i can see, see another guy
3584	5	A	but, you know, he's --
3584	6	B	uh-huh.
3584	4	A	i can just make out his place, you know.
3584	6	B	yeah.
3584	7	A	i've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
3584	6	B	yeah.
3584	5	A	and, uh,
3584	9	B	oh, that's pretty good.
3584	3	A	yeah.
3584	4	A	well, i took a lot of time in choosing this site
3584	6	B	uh-huh.
3584	7	A	because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
3584	13	B	oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?
3584	39	A	well, it's got a, a very small furnace.
3584	6	B	uh-huh.
3584	4	A	and a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
3584	6	B	yeah.
3584	4	A	but, in the house itself, i've been working inside, you know, these,  lo-, these  many months
3584	6	B	uh-huh.
3584	4	A	and i have not had to use the heat.
3584	9	B	wow.
3584	4	A	because it's all geothermal.
3584	6	B	yeah.
3584	9	B	that's pretty good.
3584	5	A	and with all the,
3584	5	A	see i've got,
3584	4	A	on the south side is all glass.
3584	4	A	well, as much as i could get in it, you know.
3584	6	B	yeah.
3584	7	A	and, uh, the east side is glass.
3584	4	A	i've got one, two, three, four, five,  six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet.
3584	4	A	so it's almost all glass.
3584	9	B	wow.
3584	5	A	and, # uh, #
3584	4	B	# my # wife would love that .
3584	6	A	oh, yeah.
3584	4	A	i mean, # you know. #
3584	4	B	# she loves # lots of windows.
3584	7	A	there's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
3584	9	B	that's great.
3584	5	A	so, uh,
3584	13	B	is it a single story?
3584	39	A	well, not really.
3584	4	A	it's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
3584	14	B	oh, i see.
3584	5	A	so the first, you know,
3584	5	A	the, the, the,
3584	4	A	what i call residential level
3584	6	B	uh-huh.
3584	7	A	at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
3584	14	B	um, i see.
3584	4	A	and the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.
3584	14	B	oh.
3584	2	A	so i've got a pretty good grade there.
3584	6	B	yeah.
3584	4	A	and then when i put the verandas whi-, which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides
3584	6	B	uh-huh.
3584	7	A	that will define the shop.
3584	6	B	yeah,
3584	13	B	that's kind of like, like a victorian style?
3584	23	A	exactly.
3584	6	B	yeah.
3584	4	B	i, i've always liked that.
3584	5	B	the,
3584	4	B	you know, i, we don't have much yard
3584	4	B	but i built a small deck in the back.
3584	6	A	uh-huh.
3584	4	B	but, you know, i, i see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.
3584	6	A	uh-huh.
3584	4	B	i, i kind of wish i had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck.
3587	2	A	uh, it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year
3587	4	A	but, uh, it's, it's camping.
3587	6	B	really.
3587	20	B	when was the last time you went?
3587	4	A	the last time i went camping was about, uh, in the middle of october,
3587	4	A	and we went up to lake bonham and really enjoyed it.
3587	4	A	had a real good time with the family.
3587	4	A	we do an awful lot of camping.
3587	1	A	how about yourself?
3587	4	B	well, i haven't been in probably about three years.
3587	6	A	uh-huh.
3587	4	B	and the last time we went was in, um, well, i guess it was, it was like hunting season,
3587	4	B	and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake
3587	6	A	uh-huh.
3587	7	B	lake sam rayburn
3587	6	A	yes, oh,
3587	7	B	which is in east texas.
3587	9	A	very good.
3587	2	A	i bet it's pretty over there.
3587	4	B	it is real pretty.
3587	21	B	um, let's see.
3587	20	A	# what do you think, what kind of #
3587	13	B	# do you do a lot of fishing? #
3587	7	A	camping, uh, are you talking about?
3587	13	A	do you go out,
3587	13	A	and is camping for you in a motor home, or a trailer,
3587	15	A	or do you actually put up a tent
3587	5	A	or,
3587	4	B	one of the ones that you pull along
3587	14	A	oh, okay,
3587	29	A	so you have,
3587	13	B	and then pop-u-, is it pop-up?
3587	19	A	yeah.
3587	6	B	pop-up.
3587	13	A	a pop-up trailer, huh.
3587	19	B	yeah.
3587	20	B	what do you have?
3587	4	A	we have a tent.
3587	32	B	a tent?
3587	19	A	yes .
3587	4	A	so i guess we really rough it.
3587	6	B	really.
3587	4	A	and we really enjoy that.
3587	4	A	uh, one thing, uh, i've done all sorts of camping.
3587	4	A	i've, i've camped, uh, in the snow on a glacier.
3587	4	A	i've camped, uh, basically almost anywhere, even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that, that camping trip and had to pack it back out.
3587	29	B	so you're a serious camper.
3587	3	A	well, we enjoy it, yeah.
3587	4	A	but since i've been married and with a family, uh, we have to go where there's restrooms .
3587	9	B	well, that makes sense.
3587	7	A	and playgrounds, and so forth,
3587	4	A	so, we really enjoy it.
3587	4	A	but also while i was growing up, we did have a trailer,
3587	4	A	and, uh, i camped in that trailer and in a tent and in, in log cabins and so forth too.
3587	4	A	so a lot of different things.
3587	5	A	and yes,
3587	5	A	i,
3587	4	A	to answer your questions earlier, yes, i, we do enjoy fishing,
3587	4	A	and i do go fishing.
3587	4	A	haven't done a whole lot down here.
3587	4	A	we recently moved from the rocky mountain area up in, uh, northern utah down to here because of work, and, uh, haven't been able to enjoy fishing like i used to up there, which is, uh, clear water fishing and streams and, and rivers.
3587	13	B	but when you all went camping is that what you normally, i mean,
3587	20	B	what did you normally do?
3587	4	A	we normally, yeah,
3587	4	A	we did, we did a lot of the fishing,
3587	4	A	but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and, and just going out and seeing what there was to see, uh, in the area.
3587	2	B	i guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with where, what you're going to do when you go,
3587	4	B	and you do actually camp.
3587	3	A	oh, yes.
3587	3	A	that's true,
3587	3	A	that's true.
3587	0	A	and, * slash error
3587	13	B	did you ever like travel around to what's that, the little k o, k o a camps whenever --
3587	7	A	no, / * slash error
3587	4	A	we
3587	13	B	ever done that?
3587	7	A	never did that.
3587	5	A	they
3587	4	A	although i've stayed in k o a campgrounds, uh, we've never done that just to go around and camp.
3587	4	A	um, personally, i, when i, when we were growing up and when we were going camping, i thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground.
3587	6	B	yeah.
3587	4	A	um, you know, that was mainly for people in motor homes or, or had trailers or, and so on and so forth, where, you know, we really wanted to go camping in a tent
3587	6	B	uh-huh.
3587	4	A	and, uh, k o a is, is geared for the people that have a # hookup. #
3587	29	B	# that actually # travel, what, city to city, state to state.
3587	3	A	right,
3587	3	A	exactly,
3587	4	A	and, uh, i started out basically camping when i was, when i was in boy scouts,
3587	4	A	and we did an awful lot of that as, as a boy scout group.
3587	4	A	as i mentioned earlier, we went into wilderness areas
3587	4	A	and we camped in the snow, and in, uh, snow caves,
3587	5	A	and, and, uh,
3587	4	B	that's probably where i first started, was in girl scouts.
3587	6	A	all right.
3587	13	A	and you got a lot of that in, huh?
3587	19	B	yeah
3587	16	B	<laughter>.
3587	20	A	what do you like to do when you go camping?
3587	4	B	um, well, let's see. i just, i mean, i just like to go
3587	4	B	and, normally i go with a whole group of friends
3587	6	A	uh-huh.
3587	4	B	and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff.
3587	13	A	enjoy it, huh .
3587	4	B	roast marshmallows.
3587	29	A	tell scary, or scary stories around the fire
3587	5	A	and,
3587	3	B	yeah,
3587	4	B	or, um, take a deck of cards if we can actually see and, um, play cards and stuff.
3587	6	A	oh, yeah.
3587	4	A	you know, lots, a lot of people i've talked to have said, well, isn't camping boring?
3587	33	A	don't you get, don't you, uh, get bored and not have anything to do,
3587	4	A	but i've found out that actually we, we really enjoy getting away from the television, the telephone
3587	3	B	yeah,
3587	2	B	it's relaxing.
3587	3	A	and, yes.
3587	3	A	exactly.
3587	4	A	get out,
3587	4	A	getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping.
3587	5	B	plus, you, um,
3587	2	B	kind of makes you appreciate some, a lot of the things you take for granted.
3587	3	A	yeah
3587	16	A	<laughter>.
3587	4	B	running water
3587	30	A	running water
3587	4	B	your hair dryer
3587	24	A	and a private bathroom.
3587	4	B	curling iron.
3587	3	A	yes .
3587	1	B	what about your family.
3587	13	B	do your kids and everything like to?
3587	19	A	yes,
3587	4	A	they really do, they have a great time,
3587	4	A	and like i mentioned, uh, the, we, we've been camping a couple of times this year
3587	4	A	and the last time was in october
3587	4	A	and we went up to lake bonham,
3587	4	A	and there was a playground for them
3587	4	A	so they had swings,
3658	0	B	okay.
3658	30	A	okay.
3658	4	B	universal health insurance,
3658	41	B	right?
3658	23	A	that's right.
3658	0	B	uh, *all 3 utts should be separate slash units
3658	20	A	what would we like to say .
3658	2	A	# i think, #
3658	7	B	# well, # i think universal health insurance, like national health, like what canada has,
3658	6	A	uh-huh.
3658	7	B	is that what you're, you're thinking the subject is about?
3658	2	A	i think that's what the subject is about.
3658	13	B	did you read, uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject?
3658	13	A	in the dallas, the morning times?
3658	19	B	yeah.
3658	4	A	i guess i did not.
3658	4	B	uh, the state of washington and the state of minnesota is, uh, going to begin testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states
3658	4	B	and there's fourteen other, uh, states that are considering it. least according to the article in the paper this morning.
3658	2	B	i think it's a trend that's, that's, that's, uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need.
3658	2	B	it's getting to a point that you have to have it,
3658	2	B	you have to have some form of health insurance.
3658	2	A	well, it's been interesting that we,
3658	2	B	extremely expensive, though.
3658	3	A	yes.
3658	2	A	so we live in a society, though, where everyone if you ask them on polls, will, uh, say that they think that everyone has a right to health care.
3658	6	B	uh-huh.
3658	2	A	and yet, i don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it.
3658	0	B	well, that's the thing, you know,
3658	2	B	uh, unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are, are paying for the people that don't have health insurance.
3658	2	A	which is why people are talking about ,
3658	2	A	we ought to just admit it perhaps
3658	6	B	yeah.
3658	7	A	and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair.
3658	2	B	i don't think you, uh,
3658	13	A	you have health insurance?
3658	19	B	yes,
3658	4	B	i do.
3658	13	A	through your company?
3658	4	B	uh, through my company,
3658	19	B	yes.
3658	4	B	but i have been in a situation, uh, recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year
3658	4	B	and my wife developed cancer.
3658	4	B	we didn't have any
3658	9	A	oh, my goodness.
3658	7	B	insurance.
3658	4	B	and it was a
3658	0	A	that's must have been hard .
3658	7	B	go to parkland type situation.
3658	1	A	how was your care at parkland?
3658	2	B	uh, because it was a life threatening situation, it was very good.
3658	4	B	uh, as it, as it turned out one of the top, uh, people, or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at parkland.
3658	4	A	but, yet, parkland is not free, either.
3658	3	B	no,
3658	4	B	it's not free,
3658	4	B	but, uh,
3658	13	A	is it affordable?
3658	7	B	it's, it's a situation that because i didn't have any insurance and i was on unemployment, it was paid by the county.
3658	2	A	so you did have a good experience.
3658	31	B	i had a bad experience as it turned out.
3658	2	B	uh, i was fortunate that there was parkland.
3658	13	A	is your wife better, i hope?
3658	36	B	uh, no she passed away.
3658	0	A	i'm real sorry.
3658	40	B	that's all right.
3658	6	A	sure. / *listen; is this a question?
3658	40	B	that happens.
3658	4	A	it does happen,
3658	2	A	but it's very sad.
3658	6	B	yeah,
3658	4	B	but in any event, uh, i'm in favor of national health.
3658	4	A	well
3658	7	B	if i had
3658	7	A	so am i.
3658	7	B	to vote for it.
3658	4	A	actually, uh, i'm a pediatrician
3658	18	B	oh, is that right?
3658	4	A	and i feel very strongly about, uh, children, and, uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic
3658	6	B	uh-huh.
3658	7	A	last year.
3658	6	B	uh-huh.
3658	7	A	where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most.
3658	4	A	so, uh, i'm really quite active in trying to, uh, be proactive at least for children's issues.
3658	2	A	it's very complex, very complicated,
3658	2	A	but, uh, i strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids , basic health benefits.
3658	4	B	well, i, when i grew up and
3658	4	B	i grew up in south central kansas, uh,
3658	4	B	we had,
3658	4	B	and my mom worked for the health department, the county health department
3658	4	B	and we had x-rays every year,
3658	4	B	we had a dentist come to our school and, uh, check our teeth once a year at least.
3658	4	B	uh, we had all our flu shots taken care of, our measles, mumps, rubella and all that other stuff.
3658	5	A	um.
3658	4	B	and, uh, when my children were growing up, we didn't have that.
3658	4	B	we had to pay for it, which i wasn't opposed to paying for it.
3658	4	B	i had the money to pay for it,
3658	2	B	but i'm sure that there were people that don't.
3658	4	A	well, and the costs have, so much has gone up so much.
3658	4	A	the cost of immunizations for example, uh, and just the legal , the legal benefits, uh,
3658	2	A	that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily, et cetera.
3658	6	B	uh-huh.
3658	28	A	so, well, i don't know,
3658	2	A	it's, it is interesting,
3658	4	A	in case you didn't know, texas leads the nation in uninsured children.
3658	4	A	thirty-one percent of all texas children
3658	4	B	did not know that.
3658	7	A	do not have insurance and are not on medicaid.
3658	4	A	so, uh, one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care.
3658	4	A	and i work in the children's parkland system
3658	4	A	and it's pretty overwhelming to me.
3658	6	B	uh-huh.
3658	4	A	but, uh, it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in dallas county.
3659	0	A	set.
3659	6	B	okay.
3659	13	A	you, you got the topic, right?
3659	19	B	yeah.
3659	6	A	okay.
3659	20	A	uh, well, where in dallas are you?
3659	4	B	i'm in richardson.
3659	14	A	oh, okay.
3659	13	A	so you do re-, do recycling there?
3659	19	B	yeah,
3659	4	B	richardson has, uh, well, they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly, if it's not raining.
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	4	B	and they also have a couple of areas where you can take, uh, cans, plastic and paper, to, uh, you know, dump them off there if you don't, uh, want to wait and have a pick up, least of paper,
3659	4	B	but they don't pick up the other items.
3659	4	B	they don't pick up cans or the
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	7	B	plastic.
3659	13	A	are they going to later,
3659	13	A	do you know?
3659	27	B	i'm not sure.
3659	4	B	they only started to do the newspaper , uh, late last year.
3659	4	B	just kind of like a trial basis.
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	7	B	and see how it goes, so i don't know if they're going to pick up the other things.
3659	5	A	um.
3659	1	B	what about you?
3659	4	A	well, i'm, i'm  in dallas proper
3659	6	B	uh-huh.
3659	7	A	in the city of dallas
3659	4	A	and i know they do have, you know, a pilot program going on
3659	4	A	but it's not here.
3659	5	B	um.
3659	4	A	so they're not picking up anything .
3659	6	B	oh.
3659	4	A	so, i mean, we, we collect everything .
3659	4	A	we've got all these boxes in our garage for, you know, green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything.
3659	20	B	where do you take them?
3659	4	A	well, there's, there's a couple places.
3659	4	A	unfortunately, we can't find a place that will take everything.
3659	5	B	um.
3659	4	A	uh, there's a lot of places to take, like the plastic, uh, shopping bags
3659	6	B	uh-huh.
3659	7	A	like most of the grocery stores.
3659	6	B	uh-huh.
3659	4	A	and there's a wal-mart nearby that takes almost everything.
3659	4	A	i can't remember what it is they don't take.
3659	5	B	um.
3659	4	A	and the library will take glass.
3659	4	A	so we end up, you know,
3659	4	A	on the weekend we pack it all in the car
3659	4	A	and,
3659	16	B	<Laughter>.
3659	7	A	and  as we go places we, oh, wait, we can drop the glass off , you know.
3659	5	B	um.
3659	4	A	drop things off one at a time,
3659	4	A	but, uh, and it's kind of disappointing, i mean,
3659	4	A	i would even be happy if they just had one, you know, one place where you could do everything.
3659	4	A	you know, it would still be more convenient than what we have now.
3659	4	B	one of the people from my department, i think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the dallas shelter.
3659	5	A	um.
3659	4	B	i think it was
3659	20	A	where is that?
3659	7	B	closer to downtown.
3659	4	B	uh, she's not here anymore
3659	6	A	oh.
3659	5	B	but, uh, yeah,
3659	4	A	i'm pretty far north.
3659	4	A	i'm not, i'm, i'm, i'm just, i'm north of addison actually.
3659	6	B	oh.
3659	4	A	so i'm, i'm really --
3659	6	B	yeah.
3659	4	A	i'm,  s-, i'm  in dallas, but only technically .
3659	4	B	well, sometimes we take our, uh, we always keep our aluminum cans.
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	16	B	<Laughter>.
3659	6	A	yeah.
3659	4	B	and a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks.
3659	6	A	yeah,
3659	4	A	i've seen those.
3659	4	B	you don't get too much money back.
3659	4	B	i figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there.
3659	6	A	yeah.
3659	4	B	but normally i collect, oh, like three trash bags full
3659	6	A	yeah.
3659	4	B	and i take them over to that can bank
3659	4	B	and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans ,
3659	16	A	<Laughter>.
3659	7	B	in the can bank.
3659	4	B	don't get too much money for them
3659	5	B	but,
3659	2	A	well, you get something .
3659	16	B	<Laughter>.
3659	5	A	uh,
3659	6	B	yeah.
3659	4	A	we used to do that,
3659	4	A	but, again, that's another stop
3659	6	B	uh-huh.
3659	4	A	and it doesn't take plastic bags and, and all that sort of thing,
3659	4	A	but, uh, i think that, you know, i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is
3659	4	A	and
3659	6	B	uh-huh.
3659	7	A	so hopefully they'll do it soon.
3659	4	A	that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week
3659	6	B	uh-huh.
3659	4	A	and, where i grew up we only had one a week
3659	4	A	and that was certainly sufficient.
3659	4	A	so if they just do,
3659	4	A	one of them will be trash
3659	4	A	and the alternate time would be recyclables,
3659	4	A	that would be great.
3659	6	B	yeah.
3659	5	A	so,
3659	6	B	yeah.
3659	4	B	uh, i'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers, you know.
3659	4	B	i seem to put them out there
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	7	B	on wednesday
3659	4	B	and like sometimes they come by,
3659	4	B	sometimes they don't.
3659	6	A	oh.
3659	4	B	i'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that.
3659	5	A	um.
3659	4	B	but i could certainly have, uh, three bins out there for, you know, plastic  and
3659	6	A	right.
3659	7	B	and  tin and paper, whatever they were going to, uh, separate into and, and have them pick it up on, on one of the two days per week.
3659	4	B	that would be easy.
3659	6	A	yeah.
3659	13	A	do you have to, uh, sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that, that sort of thing
3659	15	A	or do they take the whole thing?
3659	4	B	you're not supposed to have, like the coupons in there.
3659	14	A	oh, okay.
3659	4	B	uh, or you're not supposed to put magazines in there
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	4	B	and you can't take newspapers.
3659	4	B	now at work, uh, you know, we have changed our recycling.
3659	4	B	at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle.
3659	4	B	and not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears, you can throw it in there because at first
3659	37	A	let me guess
3659	7	B	they said,
3659	4	A	you work at t i,
3659	41	A	right?
3659	19	B	yeah,
3659	4	B	at first  they said,
3659	4	A	so do i.
3659	7	B	they said,  no telephone books.
3659	6	A	yeah.
3659	2	B	you know, well, that's stupid
3659	4	B	and then they
3659	5	A	um.
3659	7	B	said no newspapers.
3659	4	B	well, in the, my department everybody gets the wall street journal.
3659	6	A	yeah.
3659	4	B	there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable.
3659	6	A	yeah.
3659	4	B	so i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it,
3659	5	B	say,
3659	4	A	well, and they take cans, now, too.
3659	6	B	yeah.
3659	7	A	which is great.
3659	4	B	i still put my cans in with the cans.
3659	4	B	i mean, i don't want it with paper.
3659	4	B	somehow that just seems weird to me .
3659	4	A	well, our department used to collect the cans anyway for the christmas tree project.
3659	4	A	and,
3659	6	B	oh.
3659	7	A	in fact we got, this past year, we got all of our money for the christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year.
3659	9	B	ooh.
3659	4	A	and it worked out really well.
3659	4	B	well, we had the one person who used to take things to the dallas shelter.
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	4	B	i think that's what that was called.
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	4	B	she collected, she used to collect from the whole department,
3659	4	B	but she took them all down to that dallas shelter place.
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	4	B	i wish i could remember the whole name of that place,
3659	4	B	but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter.
3659	6	A	uh-huh.
3659	5	B	and, yeah,
3659	4	B	she, u-, she used to collect them from everybody in the department.
3659	6	A	yeah.
3659	4	B	she'd go up and down with her little bag
3659	6	A	yeah.
3659	7	B	collecting
3659	6	A	yeah.

3666	6	A	uh-huh.
3666	2	B	and for ten dollars a week, i don't see any reason
3666	32	A	what, for

3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	30	B	yeah,
3666	2	B	but ten dollars, or what d-, what does he charge, not even that.
3666	20	B	# what does he charge me? #
3666	5	A	# well, my,
3666	4	A	i don't know. #
3666	2	B	it's like next to nothing.
3666	4	B	th-, it's ten because i,
3666	4	B	it's forty a month.
3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	4	B	but if there's five weeks, i still pay forty.
3666	6	A	yeah,
3666	11	A	but you know, you ought to get him to g-, pull the weeds.
3666	4	B	well, he won't pull weeds.
3666	4	B	he says he'll spray them,
3666	4	B	but he won't pull them.
3666	6	A	oh.
3666	4	B	uh, he won't cut them is what he won't do.
3666	6	A	uh-huh.
3666	7	B	because he said with the rocks
3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	7	B	that it's too dangerous for him to take the, the trimmer
3666	6	A	uh-huh.
3666	7	B	over the rocks
3666	2	B	and he's right.
3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	2	B	that's true.
3666	4	B	but he just says to keep spraying them so,
3666	5	A	well so,
3666	4	B	anyway, gene sprayed them once or twice for me
3666	2	B	so
3666	6	A	yeah,
3666	13	A	so
3666	7	B	that was real,
3666	7	A	you haven't, you haven't pulled any weeds lately?
3666	26	B	no.
3666	16	A	<Laughter>.
3666	26	B	no.
3666	4	B	there are two out front
3666	4	B	i thought i'd grab one of these days,
3666	4	B	but i haven't bothered as i walk on by.
3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	4	B	i started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front
3666	6	A	uh-huh.
3666	4	B	and all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds
3666	4	B	and there was dog dirt in it
3666	9	A	oh, oh, goody.
3666	4	B	and i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there
3666	4	B	and i left the whole thing
3666	4	B	and
3666	4	A	#  i thought you were going to say there # --
3666	7	B	# that was about a month ago. #
3666	7	A	i thought you were going to say there  was a snake in the weeds .
3666	4	B	i would rather a snake,
3666	31	B	no .
3666	9	A	oh, god, oh .
3666	4	B	i just left the whole thing.
3666	4	B	the bag is still out there because i haven't touched it.
3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	4	B	i haven't gone back over there.
3666	4	B	it really made me mad.
3666	9	A	oh, god.
3666	5	B	so anyway but,
3666	20	A	but, uh, how are your, your flowers, your little things you planted?
3666	13	A	did they die or what?
3666	19	B	oh, yeah,
3666	4	B	now they died.
3666	5	A	oh, they're all,
3666	5	A	so they, oh,
3666	13	A	are they going to come back in the spring?
3666	27	B	i don't know.
3666	6	A	oh.
3666	4	B	i don't know,
3666	4	B	and then i got some nice, uh, mums at thanksgiving that i put in the pots out there
3666	6	A	uh-huh.
3666	2	B	and i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather.
3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	2	B	they looked real pretty until about a week before christmas,
3666	4	B	then they started to die, too.
3666	6	A	oh.
3666	2	B	so, i don't think any of it comes back
3666	28	B	but
3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	7	B	i don't know,
3666	2	B	maybe these,
3666	4	B	sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to.
3666	4	A	i don't know, uh,
3666	5	B	so,
3666	13	A	those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me?
3666	19	B	yeah.
3666	30	A	yeah,
3666	4	A	well, they're, i know they were still blooming up until about a, a few weeks ago.
3666	18	B	really?
3666	19	A	yeah.
3666	9	B	well, that's good.
3666	2	B	they're the best kind.
3666	6	A	yeah
3666	2	A	they,
3666	2	B	they, they're like indestructible.
3666	7	A	they're  really pretty.
3666	2	B	they really grow nice
3666	4	B	and sometimes, they're not supposed to come back,
3666	4	B	but lots of times they do.
3666	6	A	uh-huh.
3666	5	B	so,
3666	6	A	yeah
3666	16	A	<laughter>.
3666	2	B	we'll see.
3666	13	B	they're letting us have a lot of time on this
3666	19	A	yeah,
3666	13	A	i mean
3666	7	B	aren't they?
3666	7	A	isn't it supposed to be five minutes?
3666	4	B	but that's because we didn't hit one for a long time.
3666	13	A	we didn't disconnect, did we ?
3666	2	B	i hope not .
3666	16	A	<Laughter>.
3666	2	B	neither one of us
3666	4	A	boy,  i hate to think --
3666	7	B	is getting paid for this.
3666	7	A	i hate to think  i'd be talking to you without getting paid .
3666	6	B	yeah,
3666	9	B	really,
3666	4	B	i know it.
3666	4	B	i can't believe this.
3666	4	B	i got somebody from
3666	32	A	what?
3666	7	B	utah
3666	6	A	uh-huh.
3666	7	B	and somebody,
3666	4	B	where was the person last night
3666	9	A	you're kidding?
3666	7	B	was from far away.
3666	18	A	really?
3666	4	B	and we get each other down the street.
3666	2	B	this is so funny.
3666	5	A	well, the, uh,
3666	4	A	i, g-, i talked to someone woman from oklahoma city and some woman from dallas
3666	4	A	and that was it.
3666	6	B	yeah,
3666	4	B	i've had dallas, arlington.
3666	4	B	i've had, uh, one plano
3666	6	A	uh-huh.
3666	7	B	and then a lady from brigham, utah whose
3666	9	A	# wow. #
3666	7	B	# son # lives in plano on ranier someplace.
3666	18	A	really?
3666	7	B	and then, uh, another state,
3666	4	B	i can't remember,
3666	4	B	but she told me about the utah jazz,
3666	4	B	we talked about basketball.
3666	18	A	oh, really ?
3666	4	B	and i don't remember what, what the place was last night,
3666	4	B	but
3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	7	B	i'm thinking colorado,
3666	4	B	but i'm not sure
3666	4	B	i'd know the place, anyway.
3666	6	A	uh-huh.
3666	5	B	so,
3666	28	A	i don't know,
3666	5	A	th-,
3666	4	B	but mostly they're from the area.
3666	6	A	yeah.
3666	5	B	it,
3666	2	A	well, there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes.
3666	3	B	not for me.
3666	4	A	not for me
3666	4	B	you know,  not --
3666	7	A	either.
3666	20	A	what
3666	7	B	not  for me
3666	7	A	do i,
3666	7	B	because all i have is rocks and weeds.
3666	6	A	yeah,
3666	4	A	but i don't, you know,
3666	4	A	i, what do i do, cut it one, you know, and, and edge it
3666	4	A	and that's about it.
3666	4	B	i know.
3666	20	A	what do i do with it?
3666	4	B	i know,
3666	2	B	we're not typical texans.
3666	3	A	no.
3666	5	B	bu-, ,
3666	20	A	what's going on,
3666	13	A	are they going to tell us to stop or what ?
3666	27	B	i don't know,
3666	4	B	i hope so.
3666	16	A	<Laughter>.
3666	11	B	come on,
3666	11	B	come on.
3666	13	A	isn't it five minutes?
3666	27	B	i don't know.
3666	4	A	i, i mean, i'm all talked out about gardens.
3666	4	B	i know.
3666	37	B	well, we can talk about something else.
3666	4	B	it's just a suggested topic.
3666	13	A	oh, oh, it's just suggested?
3666	1	B	so, how's the baby, do you think ?
3666	32	A	what?
3666	20	B	how's the,
3666	37	A	we could talk,
3666	11	B	let's talk about the baby.
3666	7	A	let's talk  about the baby.
3666	16	B	<Laughter>.
3666	16	A	<Laughter>.
3675	13	A	do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan?
3675	19	B	yeah,
3675	4	B	our budgeting plan includes me getting a job .
3675	16	A	<Laughter>.
3675	4	B	we're, we're at the point now,
3675	4	B	i go-, i quit working about six months ago to start this house
3675	6	A	uh-huh.
3675	4	B	and i'm out of cash
3675	4	B	and i'm not out of project yet.
3675	9	A	oh, no.
3675	4	B	so, uh, i'm going to go back and do some consulting work.
3675	4	B	as far as budget's concerned, i'm, i'm fairly fortunate.
3675	4	B	uh, we've, we're  right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes.
3675	4	B	so, you know, the project's kind of halted until then.
3675	4	B	but as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, d you know,
3675	4	B	we always put ten percent back,
3675	4	B	and that's a never touch.
3675	29	A	uh, into savings.
3675	3	B	yeah.
3675	6	A	oh.
3675	4	B	either savings or investment, one of the two,
3675	4	B	but we don't ever put it in a high risk.
3675	4	B	it's just always going to be there.
3675	9	A	well, that's pretty good.
3675	2	B	and as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what i would call extravagant expenses, you know,
3675	4	B	we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food
3675	9	A	boy, that's pretty good.
3675	4	B	and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house.
3675	2	B	and, uh, you know, i'm fairly fortunate.
3675	4	B	i mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because i'm
3675	6	A	sure.
3675	7	B	a little behind on that,
3675	4	B	but, uh, we're still making the payments on them.
3675	4	B	it's just, when you,
3675	4	B	see in texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
3675	6	A	# yeah, #
3675	7	B	# and do it yourself. #
3675	4	A	it's, it's tough here too.
3675	4	A	you have to have the contractor sign with you.
3675	3	B	right,
3675	3	B	exactly.
3675	2	A	but it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it
3675	6	B	yeah.
3675	4	A	, where i live, that is.
3675	4	B	and where i live, it, it's pretty scary, because texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that
3675	6	A	uh-huh.
3675	7	B	and you screw up, you don't get it finished,
3675	4	B	the bank can eat the contractor.
3675	29	A	oh, bad for him, huh.
3675	3	B	yeah,
3675	4	B	bad for him.
3675	4	B	but, the homeowner can't be touched.
3675	5	A	# um. #
3675	4	B	# it's a # homestead state.
3675	13	A	is that right?
3675	19	B	yeah,
3675	4	B	see right now if i quit paying any of my bills,
3675	4	B	the only thing they could do is cut off electricity.
3675	4	B	they can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. period.
3675	9	A	wow.
3675	4	B	you know. they can take your car and your clothes and your, anything
3675	4	B	that's not the tools of your trade,
3675	2	B	but as far as, uh, you know , you're pretty much bullet proof in this state.
3675	2	A	well, that's kind of handy.
3675	6	B	yeah.
3675	4	A	i just finished james michener's texas book.
3675	6	B	uh-huh.
3675	2	A	pretty interesting.
3675	6	B	uh-huh.
3675	2	A	texas has quite the history.
3675	4	B	well, you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, you know .
3675	16	A	<Laughter>.
3675	4	B	we just going to spend it all.
3675	4	A	that's kind of what we do.
3675	4	A	we, uh, we're l d s
3675	4	A	and so we pay ten percent
3675	6	B	uh-huh.
3675	7	A	tithing
3675	6	B	uh-huh.
3675	4	A	and then, you know, we put i guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account.
3675	6	B	uh-huh.
3675	4	A	but that sometimes we use for emergency type things.
3675	6	B	yeah.
3675	4	A	but, uh, and my wife doesn't work.
3675	2	A	we're fortunate that way, that i make enough to do what we want to do.
3675	6	B	yeah,
3675	6	B	yeah,
3675	2	B	we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, you know, we don't have any long term debt.
3675	4	B	you know, uh, we paid cash for car.
3675	4	B	well, we bought the car on time, one of them,
3675	4	B	but we, you know, we since paid it off.
3675	9	A	well that's pretty.
3675	4	B	the land is paid for cash,
3675	4	B	so we don't have to worry about that.
3675	9	A	that's a great position to be in.
3675	4	B	well, it's fraught with other problems .
3675	13	A	is that right?
3675	19	B	yeah,
3675	4	B	i'm not very motivated .
3675	6	A	oh .
3675	20	A	what kind of consulting do you do?
3675	4	B	uh, systems consulting. computerization for construction firms.
3675	18	A	is that right?
3675	19	B	yeah.
3675	4	A	i'm into computers, too.
3675	4	A	i --
3675	6	B	right.
3675	7	A	i'm  a e d p auditor.
3675	6	B	oh.
3675	5	A	and.
3675	13	B	you into mainframes?
3675	19	A	ye-,
3675	4	A	and p c s.
3675	18	B	an-, oh really?
3675	19	A	yeah.
3675	4	A	i'm just brushing up on, well, c plus plus.
3675	18	B	are you really?
3675	19	A	uh-huh.
3675	5	A	and,
3675	4	B	i just got that a few days ago.
3675	13	A	three oh?
3675	9	B	oh, gees,
3675	11	B	don't get me to lying.
3675	16	A	<Laughter>.
3675	4	B	i bought it at a fire sale.
3675	6	A	oh.
3675	4	B	this guy's place burned down,
3675	4	B	and he had a bunch of computer stuff,
3675	4	B	and, you know, i bought it all.
3675	4	B	it was two hundred bucks for everything he had.
3675	9	A	you got a buy.
3675	4	B	well, some of it wasn't worth anything, you know.
3675	6	A	sure.
3675	4	B	you know, a lot of the, uh, diskettes were just totally unusable.
3675	29	A	melted, # or just wet
3675	5	A	or, #
3675	3	B	# well, yeah
3675	4	B	# , or wet .
3675	6	A	okay.
3675	4	B	but i did get out of there with, uh, vermont views, which is a huge,
3686	13	A	say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one.
3686	19	B	yeah,
3686	4	B	and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors.
3686	6	A	yeah.
3686	4	B	some that, she had to, uh, label everything .
3686	13	A	she had to label everything.
3686	19	B	yeah
3686	5	B	because,
3686	20	A	what was she driving?
3686	4	B	it was a cadillac.
3686	6	A	uh-huh.
3686	4	B	and they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor
3686	4	B	and they quit making it.
3686	6	A	yeah.
3686	4	B	they rebuilt it
3686	4	B	and it never did, never did run right again.
3686	6	A	yeah,
3686	4	A	quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right.
3686	6	B	yeah.
3686	20	A	uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?
3686	4	B	uh, a maverick and also, uh, a chrysler station wagon before that.
3686	6	A	yeah.
3686	13	A	did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the chrysler station wagon or the whole starter?
3686	5	B	uh, the,
3686	4	B	i'm replacing the, two or three starters on the chrysler.
3686	6	A	yeah.
3686	5	B	they,
3686	4	A	the starters are kind of fragile.
3686	6	B	yeah
3686	5	B	and the,
3686	4	A	especially if you need a tune-up.
3686	6	B	uh-huh.
3686	4	B	they kept saying that the chrys-, that's what chryslers did, is they wore out starters.
3686	6	A	yeah,
3686	4	A	well, i-, i-, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key
3686	4	A	and it starts up
3686	6	B	yeah.
3686	4	A	and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time.
3686	6	B	uh-huh.
3686	4	A	see, they built that starter so it would fit every v eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years.
3686	6	B	right.
3686	4	A	they all take the exact same starter.
3686	4	A	they'll interchange completely.
3686	4	A	i mean completely.
3686	4	A	one starter will fit all of them.
3686	4	A	so they've got a whole lot of torque,
3686	4	A	but to do that, they did it,
3686	4	A	use an underdrive system,
3686	4	A	but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast
3686	6	B	uh-huh.
3686	7	A	so it's got, to spin for very long,
3686	4	A	it's kind of tough on the bushings.
3686	6	B	yeah.
3686	4	A	usually what goes is the bushings.
3686	6	B	right.
3686	4	A	you take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly good starter.
3686	4	A	but, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with g-, with good enough bushings.
3686	6	B	uh-huh.
3686	5	A	so it's, you know,
3686	4	A	after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up.
3686	6	B	yeah.
3686	20	A	anyway, what are you driving now?
3686	4	B	uh, my chrysler van
3686	4	B	and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know,
3686	4	B	and, uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a chevrolet cavalier station wagon
3686	4	B	and it didn't give me any trouble at all.
3686	9	A	that's good.
3686	6	B	yeah.
3686	13	A	it was a late model,
3686	13	A	is that chrysler van?
3686	23	B	it's a eighty-seven.
3686	6	A	yeah,
3686	13	A	one of the little mini vans?
3686	6	B	uh-huh,
3686	6	B	yeah.
3686	5	B	is a,
3686	4	A	do you like the way it rides and stuff?
3686	13	B	uh, rides or runs?
3686	13	A	rides rough?
3686	5	B	it,
3686	19	B	yeah,
3686	19	B	well, yeah,
3686	4	B	it rides, rides rough,
3686	4	B	it runs good.
3686	6	A	yeah.
3686	5	B	you know, i kind of,
3686	4	B	it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine.
3686	6	A	yeah.
3686	4	B	you have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway.
3686	6	A	yeah,
3686	4	A	right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy.
3686	6	B	yeah.
3686	4	A	but, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too.
3686	13	B	you driven american cars all,
3686	19	A	uh, yeah,
3686	4	A	i've driven one im-, uh,
3686	4	A	i drove a volkswagen beetle for a while, about a month.
3686	4	A	uh, in a month i think i put, uh, three oil coolers on it.
3686	5	B	go-,
3686	4	A	uh, every time i turned around i was having trouble with it.
3686	6	B	uh-huh.
3686	4	A	everything else i ever owned was american built. uh, mostly older cars.
3686	4	A	uh, i've been a mechanic,
3686	4	A	well, i worked, starting working my father's service station when i was about, uh, twelve.
3686	6	B	uh-huh.
3686	4	A	so, i've been around cars a lot, but, uh, driven a lot of old pontiacs.
3686	4	A	my first three cars were, uh, seventy model pontiacs. a g t o and a bonneville and a station wagon.
3686	4	A	i had a couple of chryslers.
3686	4	A	had a super b for a while with a four forty in it.
3686	6	B	uh-huh.
3686	4	A	it was a lot of fun.
3686	16	B	<Laughter>.
3686	5	A	but, uh,
3686	4	B	not much gas mileage, though.
3686	28	A	i don't know,
3686	4	A	gas mileage wasn't too bad.
3686	4	A	it got about seventeen.
3686	9	B	oh, wow.
3686	4	A	well, till you got crazy with it.
3686	4	A	you know, you get the four barrel all worked up
3686	4	A	and suddenly  it, it, it drops off fast,
3686	4	A	but
3686	6	B	yeah.
3686	7	A	long as you didn't spin the tires too much or, or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it, it didn't do too bad on gas.
3686	4	A	didn't have to work too hard to move the car around.
3686	13	B	now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs?
3686	19	A	oh, yeah,
3686	19	A	yeah,
3686	4	A	definitely.
3686	6	B	uh-huh.
3686	6	A	yeah,
3686	5	A	the,
3686	4	A	my last g m car was a seventy chevy station wagon
3686	4	A	and it still had the points and condenser in it.
3686	4	A	when i rebuilt the engine on that, about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car.
3686	6	B	yeah.
3686	4	A	i, uh, pulled that old points distributor out and got, an h e i distributor, electronic distributor put into it.
3697	0	A	okay,
3697	2	A	now then you heard the question,
3697	33	A	# what # --
3697	6	B	# uh-huh. #
3697	7	A	what  do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs?
3697	4	B	well, i'll tell you, i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on, than i do now.
3697	6	A	okay.
3697	4	B	i do, uh, i do the easy stuff now.
3697	4	B	i change oil,
3697	4	B	uh, and then what some people would consider a little more difficult, i, i'll change spark plugs
3697	4	B	and
3697	5	A	um.
3697	7	B	i'll change, you know, points and, you, you know, do air filters, that kind of stuff.
3697	5	A	well.
3697	4	B	but, uh, i can't do as much as i used to,
3697	4	B	um, i used to do a whole lot more, but not any more,
3697	4	B	they're just too weird to work on now.
3697	13	A	is that the reason you're not doing it,
3697	15	A	or are you so busy you don't have time to do it?
3697	4	B	well, that's part of it
3697	5	A	uh.
3697	3	B	yeah,
3697	4	B	part of it is, like you said, i don't have time.
3697	14	A	okay.
3697	4	A	well being a female and being alone, you, i don't do anything but put gasoline,
3697	16	B	<Laughter>.
3697	7	A	in my car, and let someone else check the oil even.
3697	6	B	uh-huh.
3697	13	A	but, uh, have you had any major repairs recently?
3697	36	B	well, um, on this car i've got now, no,
3697	4	B	but i had a van before,
3697	4	B	and it was only two years old,
3697	4	B	and it had transmission go out on it.
3697	6	A	oh.
3697	4	B	but fortunately that was covered under the warranty.
3697	6	A	okay.
3697	4	A	well, you should be, feel very fortunate.
3697	4	A	i had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile
3697	5	B	um.
3697	4	A	and i'll declare, that's an expensive.
3697	3	B	oh, yeah.
3697	3	A	yes,
3697	6	A	uh-huh.
3697	16	B	<Laughter>.
3697	4	A	maybe i should have just traded the car in.
3697	6	B	yeah,
3697	2	B	sometimes it makes you wonder.
3697	5	A	oh, it just,
3697	4	A	well, i have a very comfortable car
3697	6	B	uh-huh.
3697	7	A	and i have a health problem that i need a large comfortable car.
3697	6	B	uh-huh.
3697	4	A	so, um, anyway, i have a new transmission,
3697	16	B	<Laughter>.
3697	2	A	and i'm sure that any of them would have cost al-, or charged me almost the same amount.
3697	5	A	but --
3697	6	B	yeah.
3697	4	A	it hurts,
3697	16	B	<Laughter>.
3697	7	A	it hurts  real bad.
3697	13	B	did you take it to a dealership?
3697	26	A	no,
3697	4	A	i took it to an independent
3697	6	B	uh-huh.
3697	7	A	out in garland.
3697	14	B	oh, i see.
3697	5	A	i had, um,
3697	4	A	these people were recommended by a neighbor
3697	6	B	uh-huh.
3697	4	A	and, you know, that's the only thing,
3697	4	A	i am not a native of dallas.
3697	6	B	oh, i see.
3697	4	A	so that means i have to depend on, on trustworthy friends
3697	6	B	right.
3697	5	A	and that's.
3697	4	A	anyway, it's fixed,
3697	4	A	it's running,
3697	4	A	and i pray that i get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it.
3697	9	B	oh, gosh.
3697	6	A	uh-huh.
3697	2	B	it's going to run for a li-, for a while yet.
3697	9	A	oh, i know it.
3697	16	B	<Laughter>.
3697	4	A	it certainly is frightening.
3697	20	A	what work are you in?
3697	4	B	uh, i, i work for t i.
3697	6	A	oh.
3697	4	B	i, i work in the networking area.
3697	6	A	okay,
3697	6	A	okay.
3697	13	B	do you work for t i?
3697	26	A	no.
3697	30	B	no,
3697	6	B	okay.
3697	26	A	no,
3697	4	A	i have just retired from, um, the southwest medical center.
3697	6	B	oh.
3697	4	A	yeah, where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car,
3697	4	A	but they're all too busy.
3697	5	A	so.
3697	6	B	yeah.
3697	4	A	i have to do it the other way,
3697	4	A	and that's find someone and pay them to do it.
3697	6	B	yeah,
3697	6	B	yeah.
3697	0	A	so i certainly hope you have a nice new year.
3697	0	B	oh, yeah,
3697	4	B	i'm, i'm planning on it.
3697	4	B	oh, it can't be any worse than last year,
3697	4	B	that's for sure.
3697	2	A	oh, it could be,
3697	16	B	<Laughter>.
3697	2	A	but i don't much think so .
3697	6	B	yeah.
3697	9	B	that's true,
3697	9	B	that's true.
3697	4	A	i'm, well, we're starting out a new one,
3697	11	A	so let's make it a good one.
3697	3	B	yeah,
3697	4	B	i'm going to try and plan on it.
3697	6	A	okay.

3711	4	B	well, i am not sure.
3711	4	B	uh, i guess hawaii is one of my favorite places.
3711	13	A	really?
3711	19	B	yeah.
3711	13	A	better than europe?
3711	36	B	well, no that is exciting.
3711	4	B	you know, i have been several times
3711	4	B	so after the first time it is like anywhere.
3711	6	A	oh.
3711	4	B	you know, it loses that newness,
3711	0	B	but yeah
3711	4	B	i love it.
3711	4	B	i love to go over to europe.
3711	4	B	i do
3711	4	B	and mostly i travel through germany and switzerland
3711	4	B	and we have good friends in england
3711	4	B	so
3711	6	A	uh-huh.
3711	7	B	i have been there quite a bit
3711	4	B	and i just love it all.
3711	4	B	i love to look at the different people and the different cultures and
3711	6	A	sure.
3711	7	B	to see how different they are from things are from the way we do them.
3711	6	A	uh-huh.
3711	7	B	the most interesting part, more than the museums, and things like that.
3711	6	A	uh-huh.
3711	1	B	so how about you?
3711	6	A	yeah.
3711	4	A	well, uh, i have been to canada several times
3711	4	A	but, uh, that is about it for me.
3711	4	A	i, i am from denver
3711	6	B	uh-huh.
3711	4	A	and so, uh, growing up, uh, we would spend most of our vacations right there in colorado.
3711	4	A	uh, my family is, uh, uh, real into camping and four wheeling,
3711	5	A	and so, uh, several,
3711	4	A	i, i, think, maybe, uh, four summers in a row, uh, we spent, uh, our vacation time in the summer, uh, four wheeling through, uh, portions of, uh, the southern half of colorado
3711	4	A	and, and, uh, every time, uh, my mother had, uh, uh,
3711	4	A	i have two other sisters
3711	4	A	and my mother had us, uh, do some studying of the, the, area which we going to visit
3711	4	A	and then we had to write, uh
3711	9	B	oh no .
3711	7	A	reports, reports about it during, during our vacation. which, which, was really fun.
3711	4	A	it was really fun.
3711	4	A	we, we, each got to write little books.
3711	4	A	# uh #
3711	6	B	# uh-huh. #
3711	7	A	and, uh, it had sparked an interest that, uh, of mine,
3711	4	A	uh, my fiancee is a very very good photographer.
3711	4	A	that is what she had originally gone to school to do. was photography
3711	6	B	uh-huh.
3711	4	A	and, uh, i, i, am close to receiving my english degree, uh, as, as, well as my, my, graduate degree,
3711	4	A	so, so, i, uh, uh, we have thought very seriously of trying to, uh, incorporate travel into and writing a book about, uh, some portion of travel, uh,
3711	4	A	so we are hoping soon, uh, not soon, maybe within the next ten years to get to, to take a trip over from, uh, over to europe and take, uh, a trip from the northern portion of france
3711	6	B	uh-huh.
3711	7	A	uh, down to the southern tip of spain, uh, and follow.
3711	4	A	it is kind of a backward s shape, uh, trail that the pilgrims use to take, uh, in, in, uh, back in the medieval times, uh, to see the relics, uh, in, uh, southern spain
3711	6	B	uh-huh.
3711	7	A	and in italy
3711	4	A	and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic and romanesque monasteries and, uh, just take that journey all the way down
3711	6	B	right.
3711	7	A	and then right a book about # it. #
3711	4	B	# that # would be quite a project.
3711	3	A	yeah,
3711	4	A	it would be
3711	6	B	yeah.
3711	4	A	uh, it, it is our big dream.
3711	2	B	well, it would be a lot fun.
3711	2	B	you know, there is good and there is bad
3711	4	B	and my experience in italy was not my favorite for sure.
3711	4	B	but,
3711	5	A	oh, su-, uh,
3711	18	A	really?
3711	7	B	well, i flew into milan.
3711	6	A	uh-huh.
3711	4	B	my daughter is, uh, a twirling champion
3711	6	A	uh-huh.
3711	4	B	and she had to perform over there and, in turin
3711	4	B	and so we had to fly into milan
3711	4	B	and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the italians, even if they speak english, they do not want to let you know
3711	9	A	oh, sure.
3711	4	B	and they gave us all the wrong directions
3711	6	A	oh.
3711	4	B	and there were just two of us.
3711	4	B	at the airport they put us on the wrong bus .
3711	4	B	finally, we saw a policeman.
3711	4	B	he put us on the subway.
3711	6	A	uh-huh.
3711	4	B	we sat there, uh,
3711	4	B	we did not know italian.
3711	4	B	we looked at each other.
3711	4	B	we said things like spaghetti .
3711	6	A	uh-huh.
3711	7	B	you know things like that.
3711	4	B	we finally followed some kids who told us where to get off.
3711	4	B	we followed these kids with, uh, gym bags
3711	4	B	and we figured that must be the sports arena
3711	6	A	uh-huh.
3711	4	B	and we lucked out
3711	4	B	and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground.
3711	4	B	i mean  it was so,
3711	6	A	wow.
3711	7	B	it was  kind of a nightmare.
3711	4	B	but, that was our experience
3711	2	B	and i guess all of italy is not like that.
3711	6	A	right.
3711	4	B	but where we were, it certainly was
3711	4	B	and the hotel that we stayed in,
3711	4	B	we stayed with our english friends, their team in the hotel
3711	4	B	and it was beautiful.
3711	4	B	it was very modern.
3711	6	A	uh-huh.
3711	4	B	but it was very far away on a bus.
3711	6	A	oh.
3711	4	B	so, you know, it was, it was really, uh, it was interesting.
3711	4	B	you always learn something.
3711	6	A	yeah,
3711	6	A	yeah.
3711	2	B	and you always have a fun experience
3711	2	B	so it is great. you know.
3711	13	A	you said that you have been to england several times?
3711	19	B	uh-huh.
3711	13	A	i wonder, have you ever been to a, uh, a small town, uh,
3711	4	A	well it is actually about thirty minutes from salisbury.
3711	4	A	it is called, uh, bemerton?
3711	26	B	no,
3711	4	B	i have not. huh-uh.
3711	6	A	okay.
3711	4	B	our friends live like an hour outside of england, like ash, around there.
3711	6	A	oh, okay.
3711	6	A	# alright,
3711	6	A	yeah. #
3711	5	B	# so, uh-huh. #
3711	4	A	uh, uh, the reason i am curious, i, uh,
3711	4	A	the other place i would like to visit, uh,
3769	0	A	okay,
3769	4	A	it's pressed.

3769	23	B	i'm ready .
3769	14	A	okay .
3769	20	A	so what's, uh, things that you look for when you go out to dinner?
3769	4	B	oh, i just like a nice, quiet, nice atmosphere
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	7	B	and of course good food .
3769	4	B	that's always, that's always a concern, but just a nice quiet easy place
3769	6	A	huh.
3769	7	B	maybe candlelight something
3769	9	A	um, that sounds pretty.
3769	7	B	just to relax, you know
3769	7	A	yeah.
3769	7	B	because i don't really go out to dinner that much,
3769	5	B	so.
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	4	A	well, we don't go out to dinner that much either.
3769	4	A	we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or
3769	6	B	uh-huh.
3769	7	A	something like that,
3769	4	A	but i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean, you know.
3769	6	B	right.
3769	4	A	um, i've been to some that's been terrible.
3769	2	A	you know, you see cockroaches crawling around and
3769	6	B	oh .
3769	7	A	everything, you know.
3769	4	A	but i try to get one that's nice and clean
3769	4	A	and then i like to, you know, good food and good service.
3769	6	B	yeah.
3769	5	A	so.
3769	6	B	yeah,
3769	2	B	where you don't feel rushed, you know
3769	6	A	yeah,
3769	6	A	right.
3769	2	B	and you can just relax, and
3769	6	A	right,
3769	6	A	right.
3769	7	B	stay as long as you want.
3769	13	A	so is there some nice places to go to eat in plano?
3769	23	B	well, nearby.
3769	4	B	we're almost in dallas.
3769	4	B	we're just north of dallas.
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	4	B	so we have quite a bit between us and there.
3769	4	B	it's about ten miles
3769	6	A	uh-huh,
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	4	B	and there is all kinds of restaurants
3769	4	B	and, i had one that was a favorite for a long time,
3769	4	B	and then it changed hands and doubled the prices
3769	4	B	and then it finally went out of business.
3769	6	A	um.
3769	4	B	so, but it was really nice.
3769	4	B	it had a fireplace.
3769	9	A	um, that sounds beautiful.
3769	3	B	yeah,
3769	2	B	it was really nice.
3769	4	B	they had entertainment sometimes
3769	4	B	and
3769	6	A	uh-huh,
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	7	B	you could just really relax there and enjoy it.
3769	6	A	uh-huh,
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	4	A	well.
3769	4	B	but it's gone .
3769	7	A	this is only a little small city.
3769	5	A	uh, we have, uh,
3769	4	A	excuse me, i didn't think my coughing would come back.
3769	4	A	anyhow, we have only like one, uh, restaurant that's kind of nice.
3769	4	A	you know, they have prime rib on, uh, weekends
3769	6	B	uh-huh.
3769	4	A	and then they have about six miles from here is called, a little city called wesley,
3769	4	A	and they have a wesley hotel there that they serve food,
3769	4	A	and the atmosphere there is really, really nice.
3769	9	B	oh, that's nice.
3769	4	A	so, and then if we really want to, you know, something different we go to modesto
3769	6	B	uh-huh.
3769	7	A	which is like twenty minutes away.
3769	6	B	right.
3769	4	A	but, uh, we don't have any fast foods here in this small city .
3769	2	B	that is probably very fortunate for you.
3769	13	B	do you have kids?
3769	32	A	do i have kids?
3769	19	B	yeah.
3769	23	A	well, i have a son,
3769	4	A	but he's grown up.
3769	4	B	oh, because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night, you know,
3769	4	B	and
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	7	B	now's she's graduated to two cheeseburgers,
3769	4	B	so something's happened here,
3769	4	B	but, but, um, you know, mcdonald's is definitely at the top of her list,
3769	4	B	and i hate these places.
3769	6	A	yeah.
3769	13	A	all the kids seem to love mcdonald's don't they, you know.
3769	19	B	uh-huh,
3769	23	B	they do,
3769	2	B	and i don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have.
3769	3	A	no,
3769	3	A	no,
3769	4	A	i'm sure there isn't.
3769	4	B	well, we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	2	B	and it's really, it's tempting when you come home from work
3769	2	B	and you're tired
3769	2	B	and, you know, you just are tempted to give in to that,
3769	2	B	and it costs a lot of money to do it too.
3769	9	A	# i know. #
3769	2	B	# you know, it # adds up
3769	2	B	and it's not healthy,
3769	4	B	and i really got into that habit for a while,
3769	4	B	but i got out of it again because
3769	6	A	yeah.
3769	7	B	i just felt like
3769	6	A	yeah.
3769	7	B	it was just too unhealthy.
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	5	B	so.
3769	20	A	well, let's see, what else can we talk about? .
3769	1	B	well, how's california today? .
3769	4	A	oh, it's foggy and cold here.
3769	18	B	is it?
3769	4	B	that's what i've heard, yeah.
3769	6	A	uh-huh,
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	6	A	yeah
3769	5	A	and it's.
3769	13	B	have you always lived there?
3769	23	A	i came from iowa when i was sixteen
3769	14	B	oh.
3769	4	A	so i've lived out in california for a long, long time.
3769	13	B	and you like it?
3769	19	A	yeah,
3769	4	A	i like it real well.
3769	6	B	yeah,
3769	5	B	we've been.
3769	4	A	we used to live in oakland,
3769	4	A	so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there
3769	6	B	oh, yeah.
3769	7	A	you know,
3769	4	A	but, uh, then i quit work and everything
3769	4	A	and i bought a house.
3769	4	A	i had a condo in oakland,
3769	4	A	so, right in chinatown, so we went to lots of  restaurants
3769	9	B	oh, that would be fun.
3769	7	A	chinese restaurants,
3769	4	A	and they were really good,
3769	4	A	i really miss them. # you know. #
3769	6	B	# yeah.
3769	13	B	# do you miss living there?
3769	26	A	uh, no,
3769	4	A	i really don't miss
3769	30	B	# no. #
3769	7	A	# living there.
3769	4	A	# i just like to go in there and have a nice chinese
3769	6	B	yeah.
3769	7	A	dinner once in a while, you know.
3769	6	B	yeah.
3769	4	A	but, uh, as far as missing living there, no.
3769	5	B	um.
3769	4	A	it's close enough if i wanted to go there, to san francisco for dinner or something, why, you know, an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and
3769	6	B	yeah.
3769	7	A	you know, have dinner and then come on back.
3769	13	A	but, uh, have you ever been to california?
3769	19	B	oh, yeah,
3769	4	B	i go all the time.
3769	18	A	oh really?
3769	19	B	yeah,
3769	4	B	well i have a twenty-one year old daughter in college there
3769	5	A	um.
3769	4	B	and she, um, is a world champion twirler
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	4	B	and her coach is in california.
3769	4	B	so she went there for six years.
3769	5	A	um.
3769	4	B	so i went out a lot with her.
3769	6	A	uh-huh,
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	19	B	and, uh, yeah,
3769	4	B	i know california pretty well.
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	4	B	and i love it, #
3769	4	B	and #
3769	0	A	# . #
3769	7	B	we tug back and forth who's going to move,
3769	4	B	but i think he's going to move because i'm the person with more to lose here.
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	4	B	i have my twelve year old in school
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	4	B	and she's happy.
3769	4	B	she always lived here in the south,
3769	4	B	and i have my house,
3769	4	B	so
3769	6	A	uh-huh.
3769	7	B	i have too much to lose,
3797	4	B	i guess we're ready to talk.
3797	25	A	how you doing, howard?
3797	4	A	this is a, a subject that i'm not real well versed on,
3797	5	A	but.
3797	11	B	well, let's talk about air pollution.
3797	3	A	okay.
3797	20	B	what do you think causes air pollution in dallas?
3797	20	B	or where are you from?
3797	0	A	no.
3797	13	B	maybe you're not in dallas.
3797	0	A	okay,
3797	4	A	i'm from the, uh,
3797	4	A	i'm from dallas.
3797	4	A	i'm in richardson.
3797	14	B	okay. uh,
3797	1	A	what do you think as far as air pollution in the dallas area?
3797	4	B	well, i have some small experience in this area.
3797	4	B	the brown haze that you see if you look down central towards downtown
3797	6	A	right.
3797	7	B	a lot of that is, uh, tied up with the oxides or nitrogen although some of the kind of bluish gray stuff we see sometimes is tied up with particulates.
3797	4	B	but, uh, the, one of the major problems that dallas has is oxides and nitrogen.
3797	4	B	that's because of all the equipment that's being operated. but at the same time, uh, because we don't have, we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we,
3797	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
3797	7	B	don't get a lot of particulates.
3797	4	B	now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in dallas.
3797	6	A	right.
3797	4	B	uh, power plants since,
3797	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
3797	4	B	many of our local power plants, uh, are natural gas most of the time, uh, the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide, and n o x.
3797	4	B	there's no particulates in natural gas, of course.
3797	4	B	and we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products.
3797	4	B	we're burning fuel oil and a few other things,
3797	4	B	but gasoline, of course, now the lead's out, at least theoretically, uh, i guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur.
3797	4	B	that's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter
3797	18	A	oh, really?
3797	7	B	the sulphur, yes.
3797	4	B	and that's, uh, course hydrogen sulfide, which is when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor
3797	6	A	sure.
3797	7	B	and that goes back in with your sulphur
3797	4	B	and under the right condition you get h two s.
3797	5	B	but, anyway, uh,
3797	2	A	well, you are, you are well versed on the subject, i tell you.
3797	40	B	well, i don't know.
3797	4	A	this is not one of my better ones.
3797	4	A	i guess, i guess i notice it the most just, uh, in driving around dallas with all the, the highway equipment that's working  on the
3797	6	B	uh-huh.
3797	7	A	on,  six thirty-five and seventy-five, just the cars in general.
3797	4	A	that's where i see most of it.
3797	5	B	ro-,
3797	4	B	uh, ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is.
3797	6	A	right.
3797	4	B	and when they run rich they, they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons,
3797	4	B	and that's another part of the problem.
3797	4	B	the gas is not being burned completely.
3797	4	B	but, uh, hopefully, if we ever get our road system fixed up, this will get a lot better.
3797	4	A	oh, i don't know, i've lived here since seventy-four, howard,
3797	4	A	and, i d-, i think, i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here,
3797	16	B	<Laughter>.
3797	2	A	and i think, i think they'll be working on them long after my wife and i are gone.
3797	4	B	well, i guess, i, not trying to top you, but i grew up in dallas county and i can remember when they built the north part of north central which was built after the south part of
3797	6	A	right .
3797	7	B	central
3797	4	B	and, uh, i can remember coming over the hill down there long about, uh, i don't know, little bit north of mark-, mockingbird on up in, over those hills
3797	4	B	and i said i wonder if they'll ever need this road.
3797	16	A	<Laughter>.
3797	4	B	course, it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and are, off ramps,
3797	9	B	but, gosh,
3797	2	B	seems like, uh, those ramps might kill us yet.
3797	5	B	i,
3797	4	B	hopefully the new ones will be a lot better.
3797	9	A	i understand.
3797	4	A	i sure hope so, i tell you.
3797	4	A	you know, you get out on the, uh, interstate highways versus,
3797	4	A	i travel quite a bit
3797	4	A	and traveling from, like, dallas to austin to san antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles in the, in the stalled traffic and the busy highways, you, you, you're at your best
3797	4	A	and, i guess when you're out on the interstate, heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no build up of cars
3797	5	A	and,
3797	6	B	yeah,
3797	13	B	ron, have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty-five, i guess towards waxahachie, hillsborough on down to austin,
3797	16	A	<Noise>.
3797	7	B	you hit a point down there about, i think where they call bear creek exit
3797	19	A	yes.
3797	7	B	on just this side of the county line .
3797	4	B	right along in there somewhere, suddenly the air feels cleaner.
3797	13	B	have you noticed that?
3797	36	A	i tell you what, i, i don't think i really have,
3797	4	A	but i'm going that way tuesday
3797	37	A	and i'm going to make it a point to.
3797	4	B	well, sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing
3797	6	A	sure.
3797	4	B	but, uh, i also travel a little bit
3797	4	B	and, uh, i don't know, it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier.
3797	4	B	it may be all in my mind.
3797	3	A	oh, i know.
3797	16	B	<Laughter>.
3797	4	A	i know going to, uh, uh,
3797	4	A	i detest going to houston because it's such a,
3810	11	A	why don't you tell me about your choir.
3810	6	B	oh.
3810	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
3810	3	B	okay,
3810	4	B	well, we, uh, are a group of, uh, musicians that just kind of have, you know, formed out of a desire to sing
3810	4	B	and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they, or just real talented i should say.
3810	6	A	uh-huh.
3810	4	B	lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching. uh,
3810	5	B	others have,
3810	4	B	there's one gal that's in the, uh, plano community orchestra. uh,
3810	4	B	just, you know, different backgrounds.
3810	4	B	it's been really kind of interesting.
3810	9	A	great.
3810	5	B	so,
3810	4	A	uh, i play the piano
3810	6	B	um.
3810	4	A	and, uh, i have a four year old who, who has started to play the piano.
3810	4	A	he does that, uh, musically, listens
3810	4	A	and then he can play, which is kind of interesting.
3810	6	B	oh, yeah.
3810	2	A	i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby.
3810	6	B	uh-huh.
3810	4	A	uh, my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at music man.
3810	18	B	oh, they did?
3810	13	A	yeah,
3810	4	A	and that's
3810	20	B	how did,
3810	7	A	lots of fun.
3810	7	B	how did  they get involved in that?
3810	4	A	uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions.
3810	4	A	it was the plano repertory theatre.
3810	6	B	uh-huh.
3810	4	A	and so they went and tried out
3810	4	A	and my husband played harold hill from the music man
3810	4	A	and my son played one of the children in a band.
3810	9	B	oh, how fun.
3810	3	A	so, yeah,
3810	3	A	it was really fun,
3810	4	A	and, uh, my son plays the clarinet in his band at school,
3810	4	A	and my daughter takes piano lessons, too.
3810	6	B	uh-huh.
3810	4	A	but, uh, we just really like music.
3810	4	A	it's a, i, i especially like it as an outlet when the t v goes off,
3810	4	A	we
3810	6	B	um, uh-huh,
3810	6	B	um.
3810	7	A	get the t v off and just have some nice quiet music.
3810	6	B	yeah,
3810	6	B	yeah,
3810	9	B	that's nice.
3810	13	B	you say have your four year old taking lessons already?
3810	19	A	uh-huh.
3810	20	B	and, uh, who do you have her, or him, take it from?
3810	4	A	uh, i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches suzuki.
3810	6	B	uh-huh.
3810	7	A	which is an auditory type learning experience.
3810	4	A	you listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear-, by hearing the intervals and things like that.
3810	6	B	uh-huh.
3810	4	A	i teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know,
3810	4	A	you look at the note on the page
3810	4	A	and you play what's on the piano,
3810	4	A	but he can't learn like that.
3810	4	A	he's a delayed child.
3810	4	A	he's only about, i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.
3810	6	B	oh.
3810	4	A	and, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand,
3810	4	A	we went, wow
3810	6	B	uh-huh.
3810	33	A	we better have him do s-, do something.
3810	6	B	yeah.
3810	7	A	you know, educationally.
3810	6	B	yeah.
3810	4	A	so that was really fun.
3810	5	B	# well, because my, #
3810	4	A	# my husband and # i love to go to the musicals downtown, though.
3810	32	B	pardon # me? #
3810	4	A	# so, # my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town
3810	6	B	uh-huh.
3810	7	A	into dallas.
3810	6	B	uh-huh.
3810	4	B	well, i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five
3810	6	A	um.
3810	4	B	because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much
3810	4	B	and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play
3810	4	B	and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally.
3810	5	B	she just,
3810	2	A	oh, i think that's great.
3810	4	B	so i wasn't sure when to start her.
3810	4	B	i didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.
3810	2	A	that's really hard i think, because, especially if you start them
3810	2	A	and then they get pretty good
3810	2	A	and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something,
3810	2	A	they go, i don't want to do this anymore
3810	2	A	and you're like
3810	6	B	uh-huh .
3810	7	A	god, i really want you to do it.
3810	6	B	yeah.
3810	8	A	you know.
3810	6	B	yeah.
3810	2	A	so sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when,
3810	28	A	but, i don't know,
3810	11	A	if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.
3810	3	B	uh-huh,
3810	3	B	uh-huh.
3810	3	B	yeah,
3810	4	B	i think she'd like to,
3810	5	B	i just don't know if it's really,
3810	4	B	knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot
3810	4	B	and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.
3810	6	A	uh-huh.
3810	4	B	it was something easily forgotten.
3810	4	B	so, uh, i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight
3810	4	B	or, or should i say seven.
3810	4	B	i mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally.
3810	4	B	she does have to really work at it,
3810	5	B	but, uh, so,
3810	4	A	that's like me.
3810	6	B	yeah,
3810	4	B	but, so i'm kind of, you know, just playing with it,
3810	4	B	but at this point we're going to kind of wait, i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway
3810	5	B	but,
3810	2	A	well, it can get expensive
3810	6	B	yeah.
3810	2	A	that's for sure.
3810	6	B	yeah.
3810	4	A	i, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the suzuki method
3810	6	B	uh-huh.
3810	7	A	without paying a lot out.
3810	9	B	oh, that's good.
3810	3	A	yeah,
3810	4	A	so it's been good for our family.
3810	13	B	well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a suzuki method,
3810	13	B	have you had any former suzuki students?
3810	36	A	i don't have any suzuki students. uh,
3810	34	B	i was wondering how,
3810	4	A	something happening to me at christmas time that, that verified to me that i will al-,
3811	13	A	so you have a  child
3811	19	B	yeah
3811	5	B	we,
3811	7	A	two years old in child care right now.  *slash error
3811	23	B	two year old daughter in child care
3811	4	B	and we went through the process of searching for child care and
3811	7	A	uh-huh.
3811	7	B	uh, finding what we consider to be,
3811	16	A	<Squeak> <door>.
3811	7	B	real good child care at a, uh, pretty reasonable price, we think.
3811	5	A	uh,
3811	1	B	how about you,
3811	13	B	do you have any children?
3811	19	A	yes,
3811	4	A	our first
3811	4	A	and he just turned three months.
3811	9	B	oh, boy.
3811	4	A	so, we're just starting into hunting for child care.
3811	9	B	yeah.
3811	4	A	right now, both of us are students.
3811	18	B	are you?
3811	20	B	where are
3811	5	A	uh,
3811	7	B	a student?
3811	4	A	uh, university of southern mississippi.
3811	9	B	no kidding.
3811	5	A	uh, she's,
3811	4	B	i was a professor in a university here in california for a while.
3811	6	A	yeah.
3811	5	B	yeah,
3811	13	B	uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?
3811	23	A	uh, probably. uh,
3811	4	A	actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care f-, uh, five days a week more than likely.
3811	6	B	yeah.
3811	7	A	uh, depending on how my class schedule runs
3811	4	A	because my wife will be doing her internship that semester.
3811	6	B	uh-huh.
3811	4	A	it will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing.
3811	6	B	yeah.
3811	4	A	so , depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, si-, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point.
3811	4	A	right now we're trying to avoid it,
3811	4	A	but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him.
3811	4	A	uh, i get out of class at certain time
3811	4	A	and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. you know,
3811	4	A	once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us
3811	6	B	yeah.
3811	7	A	be home.
3811	6	B	yeah.
3811	4	A	so for about twenty min-, twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in.
3811	9	B	well, that's a good experience, i think,
3811	2	B	and, uh, there are a lot of things to think about
3811	2	B	and the articles that are written on the topic,
3811	16	A	<Thumping>.
3811	7	B	are pretty good
3811	2	B	and they kind of boil down to, uh,
3811	2	B	any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
3811	6	A	uh-huh .
3811	2	B	and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about,
3811	16	A	<Clinking>.
3811	7	B	people who were going to be loving
3811	6	A	yeah.
3811	2	B	and, uh, that's more important than anything else.
3811	4	B	we could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility.
3811	6	A	uh-huh.
3811	4	B	uh, she goes to a home.
3811	4	B	this is  a,  uh,
3811	16	A	<Clinking>.
3811	7	B	a  couple, uh, emigrated from china early
3811	6	A	uh-huh.
3811	7	B	in, in their lives.
3811	4	B	they've been here probably thirty, forty years.
3811	6	A	yeah.
3811	4	B	they've got three daughters.
3811	4	B	uh, and,
3811	16	A	<Child_yelling>.
3811	7	B	they have a loving home
3811	4	B	and, uh, they're both there
3811	4	B	and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.
3811	6	A	uh-huh.
3811	4	B	and our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going
3811	6	A	yeah.
3811	7	B	to see her friends,
3811	4	B	so
3811	9	A	uh, that makes a big difference.
3811	7	B	it's a good experience.
3811	5	B	i th-,
3811	4	B	if it's good,
3811	2	B	i think it's very good for the child.
3811	3	A	yes.
3811	2	B	and if it's,
3811	16	A	<Child_crying>.
3811	7	B	a loving environment, i think it's very good
3811	4	B	and, and that's really what we've learned about it.
3811	4	B	she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
3811	6	A	yeah.
3811	4	B	but, uh, we feel real fortunate
3811	4	B	and we were able to, uh, just, uh, choose in the marketplace.
3811	34	B	i don't know what it's like around, uh, hattiesburg.
3811	4	A	there's a lot of child care available, but
3811	6	B	uh-huh.
3811	7	A	invariably there's waiting lists.
3811	6	B	yeah.
3811	4	A	and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list
3811	6	B	yeah.
3811	7	A	with the, uh, okay, the  university, uh, university's, uh
3811	9	B	i'll bet they're involved.
3811	7	A	uh, department of,  uh, uh, their  home ec department
3811	6	B	yeah.
3811	4	A	uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, american family counseling
3811	4	A	and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus.
3811	4	A	but, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list.
3811	6	B	yeah .
3811	5	A	so,
3811	5	B	well, that's, uh,
3811	2	B	i know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for people in, in, uh, university communities.
3811	6	A	uh-huh.
3811	4	B	out here at manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility
3811	4	B	and there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that.
3811	6	A	yeah.
3811	2	B	so it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important,
3811	16	A	<Talking>.
3811	7	B	decision,
3811	2	B	it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
3811	6	A	yeah.
3811	2	B	and i think this is  # b-, really # --
3811	9	A	# well, it's best, # *slash error
3811	7	B	is buyer beware.
3811	7	A	yeah,
3811	2	A	a cottage industry's the best way to do it really,
3811	7	B	# well, it is the best way #
3811	5	A	# because if you over, #
3811	7	B	to do it, interestingly.
3811	2	B	i think that, uh, my own interest in, in development, human development
3811	6	A	uh-huh.
3811	7	B	leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, uh, private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a
3811	6	A	yeah.
3811	7	B	fundamental change in the way we learn.
3811	6	A	yeah.
3811	2	B	because, i think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market.
3811	2	B	as a matter of fact, my future is banked on that, uh, professionally because i believe that, that there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, colleges
3811	6	A	uh-huh.
3811	7	B	universities for, uh, learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care.
3811	16	A	<Noise>.
3811	2	B	primary skills which turn out
3811	3	A	yes.
3811	7	B	to be the most important skills in life.
3811	2	A	and it's amazing how much good things like, uh, sesame street will do.
3811	2	B	it's, it's phenomenal.
3811	16	A	.
3811	2	B	it's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system,
3921	0	A	okay.
3921	13	B	well, are you a fisher person, are you?
3921	19	A	yes,
3921	4	A	i love to fish.
3921	9	B	great.
3921	20	B	what kind of fishing do you do?
3921	4	A	well, it's mostly from the rivers and lakes.
3921	13	B	in california?
3921	19	A	and, yes,
3921	4	A	and from the banks.
3921	4	A	i don't like to go out on boats.
3921	6	B	oh.
3921	16	A	<Laughter>.
3921	20	B	well, what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods?
3921	5	A	well, it, uh,
3921	4	A	down here we usually catch catfish and bass, stripped bass, you know, where i fish.
3921	6	B	uh-huh.
3921	7	A	and trout up at, uh, lake shasta when i go up there.
3921	6	B	oh.
3921	4	A	but, i like it all except, uh, really i don't, i don't really care that much for the trout.
3921	4	A	i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout .
3921	4	B	well, i, i don't blame you.
3921	4	B	i grew up in nebraska and, uh, grew up fish, cat fishing in the little blue river
3921	4	B	and then, uh, we moved to, uh, south dakota
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	7	B	and, uh, did a lot of walleye fishing on the missouri river
3921	4	B	and, uh, now that we are down here, i think a lot of people do some, uh, bass fishing and strip bass fishing
3921	4	B	but, uh, i still, uh, i am sort of a catfish man at heart.
3921	13	A	see. well, uh, like in, uh, iowa and nebraska, those little bullheads, they look just like catfish, huh?
3921	19	B	yep.
3921	19	B	yeah,
3921	4	B	they do.
3921	4	A	you know that's what i mean cause i am from iowa.
3921	6	B	oh.
3921	4	A	and, uh, you know, we use to catch those little bullheads
3921	5	A	and that's,
3921	4	A	they look just like baby catfish.
3921	6	B	yeah.
3921	13	A	you know, uh, did you get to go fishing very often?
3921	19	B	oh yeah.
3921	4	B	i like to fish.
3921	4	B	the only problem is i just moved to texas
3921	4	B	so it's been a little over a year now
3921	4	B	but, uh
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	7	B	i, i am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here
3921	4	B	and i, so really i haven't gone fishing for about two years now
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	4	B	and it's driving me crazy
3921	4	B	but, uh, one of these days, i will go over to, uh, lake lewisville or, uh, what is it, uh ray hubbard, lake ray hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while .
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	16	B	<Laughter>.
3921	13	A	well, uh, you like to eat them after you catch them?
3921	16	A	<laughter>.
3921	19	B	well, yeah,
3921	4	B	sure.
3921	2	A	because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing,
3921	2	A	but they don't like to eat them.
3921	5	B	# well mo-, #
3921	7	A	# you know. #
3921	6	B	yeah.
3921	4	B	most of the time, uh, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it.
3921	3	B	uh, and you're right.
3921	4	B	i mean i like to fish for trout
3921	4	B	and they are really, uh, uh, good fighters
3921	4	B	but, uh, if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu.
3921	6	A	yeah,
3921	9	A	i know.
3921	4	A	if i go to a restaurant and order fish, it's usually either salmon or, uh, red snapper.
3921	6	B	yeah.
3921	7	A	you know .
3921	13	B	well, uh, so, do you just, uh, uh, skin your catfish
3921	15	B	or do you fillet them out,
3921	20	B	how # do you, how do you, #
3921	4	A	# we, uh, # skin them.
3921	41	B	do you?
3921	19	A	yeah.
3921	14	B	okay.
3921	6	A	yeah,
3921	6	A	yeah.
3921	4	A	just cut their heads off and skin them
3921	4	A	and then i just, uh, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them.
3921	6	B	yeah.
3921	4	A	i don't put that corn meal on them.
3921	26	B	no.
3921	4	A	you know, uh, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them
3921	5	A	so ,
3921	4	B	well, that's how we do it too.
3921	4	B	uh, although we, uh, use to set some, uh, trout lines out
3921	4	B	and we've caught, you know, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish
3921	4	B	and sometimes those are good to, uh, do on a barbecue grill
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	7	B	and just leave the skin on and, uh, do it with, uh, butter on, uh, on, on tin foil
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	4	B	and then the skin just basically scrapes right off
3921	5	B	and, uh, wer-,
3921	4	B	and it really tastes pretty good.
3921	6	A	yeah.
3921	4	A	well you know, i don't think i've ever tried cooking those, uh, catfish quite that big.
3921	5	B	there, uh,
3921	4	A	uh, most of them are just the small, you know, pan frying ones.
3921	6	B	yeah.
3921	5	A	so, uh,
3921	4	B	well, i am hoping one of these days i'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, uh, a rod and reel
3921	4	B	but, uh
3921	6	A	um.
3921	7	B	so far it's just been on, uh, on the trout lines
3921	5	B	so,
3921	13	A	wouldn't that be something?
3921	16	A	<laughter>.
3921	19	B	yeah.
3921	13	A	it's a thrill when you get a big fish though, isn't it?
3921	19	B	yeah.
3921	7	A	you know.
3921	4	B	and, uh, well up in, uh, south dakota on the, in the missouri river there we've, uh, tied into a few northern pike
3921	5	B	and, uh, they really, uh,
3921	5	B	in, in,
3921	4	B	when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish,
3921	4	B	but in the summer time, they'll, uh, give you a run for your money.
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	4	A	so when you were,
3921	20	A	when you did go fishing where did you go?
3921	20	A	you moved there from where?
3921	41	A	nebraska?
3921	19	B	uh-huh.
3921	19	B	yeah.
3921	13	A	so, it was just like the rivers and, uh, the
3921	13	B	in,
3921	7	A	lakes i suppose, huh?
3921	7	B	in  nebraska?
3921	19	A	yeah.
3921	19	B	uh, yeah.
3921	4	B	most of the time, uh, we just fished, uh, in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in.
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	4	B	and a lot of them ended up being close to the river,
3921	4	B	so if the river every, uh, flooded, you know, then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits
3921	6	A	uh-huh.
3921	4	B	and so we would do a lot of fishing there too
3921	4	B	but, uh, south dakota didn't really have much for,
4004	1	A	how do you feel about the viet nam war?
4004	4	B	huh, well, um, you know, i guess it's pretty deep feelings, uh,
4004	4	B	i just, uh, went back and rented, uh, the movie, what is it, good morning viet nam
4004	6	A	uh-huh.
4004	5	B	and, uh.
4004	6	A	yeah,
4004	4	A	i saw that as well.
4004	4	B	got that, uh, uh, some insight there, to, to kind of help me put together the feelings.
4004	4	B	i really appreciated the, the whole, uh, english class where the, uh, the, uh, fellow just wouldn't do it, you know,
4004	4	B	the guy's gouging, gouging your eyes out,
4004	8	B	what are you going to do?
4004	6	A	uh-huh.
4004	4	B	you know, what for him to finish me off .
4004	16	A	<Laughter>.
4004	4	B	and, uh, it, it was, uh, good to remember the, uh, that, that kind of asian philosophy
4004	6	A	uh-huh.
4004	13	A	# well, were #
4004	7	B	# that, uh. #
4004	7	A	you ever in viet nam
4004	5	A	or,
4004	26	B	no,
4004	26	B	no,
4004	4	B	i was kind of an in-between, uh, finally drew a high draft number,
4004	13	B	and you?
4004	36	A	um, i was much too young,
4004	4	A	i was born in sixty-seven,
4004	5	A	so.
4004	6	B	oh .
4004	4	A	um, you know, both my, well, both my brothers were, um, draft age,
4004	4	A	but neither of them wound up going over, which, i think they were very happy for.
4004	4	B	well, i, personally, uh, you know, uh, i just went in limbo.
4004	4	B	i had a passport and was ready to go
4004	6	A	uh-huh.
4004	7	B	or um, out of the country or
4004	6	A	yeah.
4004	7	B	join special forces, either one.
4004	6	A	uh-huh.
4004	4	B	i mean, i just didn't know.
4004	5	B	so, uh.
4004	13	A	well, um, so well do you, do you feel that it was worth what we did over there?
4004	19	B	um, yeah,
4004	11	B	just a second.
4004	3	A	okay.
4004	35	B	okay.
4004	35	B	sure,
4004	20	B	now. well, mark, um, what was that again?
4004	13	A	um, do you think, i mean, do you think, our invest-, the investment in lives and money was worth it?
4004	26	B	no,
4004	36	B	not, not really.
4004	3	A	i totally agree with that. # um. #
4004	5	B	# um. #
4004	20	A	what, what effects do you think it's had on our country?
4004	29	B	downside. um, uh, well,
4004	4	B	the says we should, uh, go into the grief that, that's there
4004	4	B	and, you know, presidents have always avoided that
4004	6	A	uh-huh.
4004	7	B	as a country.
4004	2	B	so it's pretty serious, really, you know,
4004	2	B	lot of things that aren't being addressed.
4004	6	A	uh-huh.
4004	2	A	i think you know, that's pretty typical that, of the entire, entire involvement over that, you know, that nothing was really addressed,
4004	2	A	it was-, it wasn't, you know, it was never
4004	4	A	we, we announced that we were going to war,
4004	4	A	it was such a gradual and subtle, you know
4004	6	B	yeah.
4004	7	A	thi-, um, you know increasement of, of force that.
4004	24	B	gulf of tonkin, uh, resolution
4004	8	B	and was it a dolphin or a torpedo.
4004	13	B	you remember that?
4004	23	A	i vaguely remember we, um, we had a, we had a, um, spy ship torpedoed or something.
4004	6	B	yeah,
4004	6	B	yeah,
4004	4	B	only only it was foggy
4004	4	B	and finally president johnson said, well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo.
4004	6	A	oh .
4004	18	B	isn't that something?
4004	19	A	uh-huh. um,
4004	13	A	so, um, do, do, do you think that like, uh, um, for example like in, in this past war, in the persian gulf war
4004	6	B	uh-huh.
4004	7	A	that, uh, that you see, it seemed to me that, that bush was going, going to extraordinary lengths to, um, you know, prepare the country for war.
4004	11	B	hey mark
4004	6	A	yeah.
4004	7	B	i've got to go, um.
4004	3	A	okay.
4004	12	B	we'll see you.
4004	4	B	i guess our five minutes are up according to me.
4004	13	B	are they to you?
4004	4	A	uh, i wasn't really keeping count.
4004	4	A	but i guess,
4004	12	A	good-bye.
4004	12	B	yeah,
4004	12	B	okay,
4004	12	B	bye-bye.
4004	12	A	bye.
4026	1	A	so. how's your products been?
4026	4	B	um, i really haven't had, uh, too many problems.
4026	4	B	uh, seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out.
4026	9	A	i hear that one.
4026	13	A	have you had any lately go out?
4026	19	B	yeah,
4026	4	B	i've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three,
4026	5	B	and they,
4026	4	B	unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time, when i bought my new house,
4026	4	B	and, uh, i really don't have any recourse,
4026	4	B	so i had to call and have them all repaired and that.
4026	9	A	oh, wow.
4026	6	B	yeah,
4026	4	B	it was a hassle.
4026	13	A	so you didn't get anything,
4026	13	A	even, all the, all the warranties were out?
4026	19	B	yeah,
4026	4	B	the warranty on the refrigerator, uh,
4026	5	B	the i-,
4026	4	B	the refrigerator warranty's still good,
4026	4	B	but the ice maker itself, passed its three years,
4026	4	B	and it was three years and two months.
4026	9	A	you're kidding.
4026	26	B	no.
4026	6	A	yeah,
4026	4	A	we just moved into a new house, too,
4026	4	A	so we had to buy all those, too.
4026	11	B	uh, watch out.
4026	3	A	yeah,
4026	4	A	the only thing i've had problems with is, um,
4026	4	A	i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail
4026	6	B	uh-huh.
4026	4	A	and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such,
4026	4	A	and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings.
4026	5	A	so.
4026	5	B	um.
4026	4	A	i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than,
4026	4	A	i just ended up using it.
4026	4	A	but, that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong.
4026	5	A	but.
4026	4	B	i usually have pretty good luck with appliances,
4026	5	B	but i just, uh,
4026	4	B	it was within two days that all three of these stopped working,
4026	4	B	and  the
4026	9	A	that's incredible.
4026	7	B	the  ice maker was, uh, had to have a new pump,
4026	4	B	and the, uh, microwave had to have, uh, some kind of something i can't even pronounce,
4026	16	A	<Laughter>.
4026	5	B	and they, uh,
4026	4	B	the dryer had to have a new heating element,
4026	4	B	so it was about, almost three hundred dollars for all three of them.
4026	13	A	and they all went out at the same time?
4026	23	B	uh, within # two days of each other. #
4026	30	A	# or two days.
4026	9	A	# wow.
4026	5	B	i was,
4026	4	B	it wasn't a good week.
4026	4	B	i was pretty mad.
4026	16	A	<Laughter>.
4026	4	B	and c plus the place that i'd bought them all had gone out of business,
4026	4	B	so even if i, i think even if i had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that manufactured,
4026	4	B	but still they were through that retailer,
4026	4	B	so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not.
4026	9	A	wow,
4026	4	A	it's frustrating.
4026	4	B	but i didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty.
4026	16	A	<Laughter>.
4026	4	B	so. it was a call to the local appliance dealer
4026	6	A	uh-huh.
4026	7	B	who came out and fixed them all,
4026	5	B	but, i,
4026	4	B	the only other things that i've ever had trouble with, uh,
4026	4	B	i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers, blow dryers.
4026	6	A	uh-huh,
4026	13	A	they go out a lot?
4026	19	B	yeah,
4026	4	B	i've had two or three of those go out.
4026	4	B	one was under warranty,
4026	4	B	and the other two weren't,
4026	5	B	but, i just,
4026	4	B	other than that, you know, t v -s and things like that, i haven't ever had any trouble with.
4026	2	B	i don't think products are getting much better though.
4026	3	A	yeah.
4026	4	A	see i'm in the manufacturing
4026	4	A	home from work
4026	4	A	and make, um, automotive air bags, the safety air bags.
4026	18	B	oh, really?
4026	19	A	yeah.
4026	9	B	that's interesting.
4026	4	A	at morton international,
4026	5	A	and, i thin-,
4026	4	A	well, it's, it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment.
4026	4	A	we test everything after each assembly process,
4026	4	A	and so our testing is pretty thorough,
4026	5	A	but.
4026	13	B	do you, do you test each individual one
4026	5	A	um.
4026	15	B	or do you just test,
4026	13	B	like if you've got ten, you test one,
4026	13	B	and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay?
4026	27	A	um, the tests that,
4026	23	A	well, we test every one electrically.
4026	5	A	we don't,
4026	4	A	i think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags
4026	6	B	uh-huh.
4026	4	A	and, but we do test after, during the assembly project, product, um, after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it,
4026	4	A	so, each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done,
4026	4	A	and then we do electrical tests on them during the process,
4026	5	A	so.
4026	4	B	well, that's something i've never had to use,
4026	4	B	it's never, i've never been involved in an automobile accident,
4026	4	B	so, luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test.
4026	6	A	yeah.
4026	4	B	but i think it's a great idea.
4026	5	B	i'm, i'm,
4026	4	B	seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about
4026	5	B	but that.
4026	4	A	well, they do the, all the testing that we have to do through the government,
4026	4	A	it's incredible how much testing they have to do.
4026	2	B	oh, i'm sure they want to be thorough before they.
4026	5	B	but, uh, even,
4026	4	B	you know, i don't mind spending the extra money on the car
4026	6	A	uh-huh.
4026	7	B	if, you know, even if they pass the savings, the cost onto the consumer, because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing.
4026	4	B	i'm not a real big seat belt,
4026	5	B	my, uh,
4037	0	A	uh, greg,
4037	4	A	uh, i, i'm not familiar.
4037	13	A	i think, uh, you guys in indiana, don't you have the, the death penalty?
4037	19	B	yeah,
4037	4	B	we do have the death penalty here.
4037	4	B	it's not exercised very often,
4037	4	B	but we do have it.
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	4	B	i believe it,
4037	4	B	i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually.
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	7	B	uh, personally i'm in favor of capital punishment.
4037	4	B	i know there's a lot of, lot of problems with it,
4037	2	B	but, uh
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	7	B	seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that, that the person just, i feel, doesn't deserve to live, doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in, in prison for life.
4037	3	A	right.
4037	4	B	but, i know there's a lot of problems with that, like, well, they say, okay, if you declare someone, put them on death row and execute them, well, then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it, then that life was wasted,
4037	2	B	but
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	7	B	just seems like in some cases that it's a, it's a good policy.
4037	3	A	uh-huh.
4037	3	A	uh, i, i tend to agree with you,
4037	4	A	uh, i've changed my views over, uh, e-, even within the last few years, uh, to be honest.
4037	4	A	uh, uh, when i was in coll-, when i was an undergraduate, i was a member of amnesty international
4037	6	B	uh-huh.
4037	4	A	and, uh, and, of course, at that time, you know, i thought, uh, uh, it was stupid to kill anybody for, uh,
4037	5	A	you know, that
4037	2	A	the eye for an eye was a stupid argument.
4037	3	B	right.
4037	2	A	but the, uh, the more,
4037	4	A	now i live in downtown dallas,
4037	4	A	and   i,  uh,
4037	6	B	right.
4037	7	A	you know, i've seen,   uh, i've seen  cases on, in the news and all where, where, you know, uh, a, a person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder.
4037	6	B	right.
4037	2	A	i think that maybe, uh, a good solution to capital punishment might be, uh, reserve it solely for, uh, repeat offenders of a crime like, uh, murder.
4037	3	B	that's a, that's a thought that i had never really had on that
4037	6	A	yeah,
4037	0	A	uh.
4037	7	B	which seems pretty sensible.
4037	7	A	yeah,
4037	2	A	it seems sensible and failsafe.
4037	5	A	i, i, uh, i don't,
4037	2	A	you know, not completely failsafe,
4037	2	A	but if a man's convicted of two murders, uh, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong.
4037	3	B	right.
4037	5	A	uh i also, uh,
4037	2	A	to tell you how liberal i have turned, uh, toward this, or, or, or whatever side that is
4037	6	B	right.
4037	6	B	yeah.
4037	7	A	i've kind of chosen, uh, i believe it that, uh, big time drug importers, like, uh, say noriega for example
4037	6	B	uh-huh.
4037	7	A	that these people need to be, uh, eliminated, uh
4037	6	B	uh-huh.
4037	7	A	from society,
4037	2	A	and i think, i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, uh, really any kind of, uh, uh, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, uh, create another power structure .
4037	3	B	yeah,
4037	3	B	you're, you're right there.
4037	5	B	uh, i gue-,
4037	4	B	basically my views, i guess they tend to be more economically oriented
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	7	B	in that i just, you know, they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars, taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail
4037	6	A	right.
4037	7	B	when they're going to be there for life, they're never going to be rehabilitated.
4037	6	A	right.
4037	2	B	i mean, i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with
4037	6	A	right.
4037	2	B	so to me i'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	7	B	to keep somebody alive who i, in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society,
4037	2	B	so i, i'm all in favor of it.
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	13	A	well, uh, do you, uh,
4037	13	A	are there cases where you think that, that, uh, the capital, the capital punishment shouldn't be, uh, uh, sentenced?
4037	28	B	well, i, i really don't know on that question.
4037	2	B	it just seems like,
4037	2	B	for instance, the jeffrey dahlmer case. i mean, i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society.
4037	2	B	i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	4	B	and in that case, wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty,
4037	4	B	so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
4037	6	A	right.
4037	2	B	and i think that, that he should not be allowed to live,
4037	2	B	but, you know, then you're kind of playing god
4037	3	A	that's true,
4037	3	A	yeah.
4037	7	B	which is n-, never a good thing to do.
4037	3	A	right.
4037	4	B	but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld, uh, not really that i can think of.
4037	2	B	i, i would, i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like, you know, murders, and like you said, repeat murders or
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	7	B	serial killers
4037	6	A	uh-huh.
4037	31	B	uh, i don't really agree with the, uh, death penalty for people like noriega and such as that.
4037	2	B	i think that they're, they're operating on a more,
4037	2	B	i mean, i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here,
4037	2	B	but i don't really think that, that it's, it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live, because
4037	6	A	right.
4037	7	B	they're feeding our consumer needs.
4037	6	A	sure,
4037	6	A	yeah,
4037	4	A	i understand, i understand your point.
4037	5	A	yeah.
4037	13	A	uh, of course, you know, with, uh, with, with dahlmer now, uh, you, you realize that ohi-, i think it's ohio, uh, gets to try him next
4037	4	A	and
4037	6	B	uh-huh.
4037	7	A	they do have the death penalty.
4037	6	B	yeah.
4037	6	A	yeah,
4037	4	A	so, uh, that was a curious case.
4037	5	A	i.
4037	6	B	yeah,
4037	4	B	that is very curious.
4037	2	A	uh, uh, something is sort of nightmarish
4037	3	B	yeah.
4037	7	A	to say the least.
4037	3	B	that's, that's right.
4037	4	A	uh, well, here in texas we, uh,
4037	4	A	i think even, even this last week, last week they had another, they, uh,
4037	4	A	you know, they use their capital punishment by lethal injection, uh, uh,
4048	0	B	pretty good,
4048	0	B	pretty good.
4048	13	B	so we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh. / *listen
4048	30	A	drug testing in the work place.
4048	4	A	um. i've been tested a few times, just before pre-, drug employment.
4048	4	A	but that's about it.
4048	4	A	i've never had random drug testing.
4048	6	B	yeah,
4048	4	B	we have random drug testing at, in my business,
4048	4	B	but i've never been, uh, never had to do it.
4048	18	A	oh, really?
4048	19	B	yeah,
4048	19	B	yeah,
4048	4	B	they started that about a year ago,
4048	2	B	and i think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff.
4048	6	A	uh-huh.
4048	4	B	but, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,
4048	5	B	# at least that's. #
4048	13	A	# oh, they do with alcohol. #
4048	32	B	pardon?
4048	13	A	they do it with alcohol?
4048	19	B	yeah,
4048	19	B	yeah,
4048	4	B	they, they, they'll check for alcohol.
4048	2	A	oh, i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine.
4048	31	B	no,
4048	4	B	once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing.
4048	9	A	huh. that's interesting.
4048	6	B	yeah,
4048	5	B	it's a,
4048	20	A	what type of field of work are you in?
4048	4	B	i'm in the oil business.
4048	30	A	oh, in the oil business.
4048	3	B	yeah.
4048	14	A	okay,
4048	13	A	and you work in the office around.
4048	19	B	yeah,
4048	4	B	i work in the office,
4048	2	B	so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment.
4048	6	A	uh-huh.
4048	16	B	<Laughter>.
4048	6	A	yeah
4048	4	A	see, i work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags
4048	6	B	uh-huh,
4048	6	B	uh-huh.
4048	7	A	for the cars,
4048	4	A	and we work around a lot of explosives.
4048	2	B	well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on.
4048	6	A	yeah,
4048	5	A	so that's, you know,
4048	4	A	i'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment i work in, you know, they're working with explosives,
4048	2	A	and so they could blow up the whole,
4048	4	A	well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,
4048	2	A	but still, it can be dangerous.
4048	3	B	yeah,
4048	3	B	yeah,
4048	3	B	well, i, i, i agree.
4048	2	B	i think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff.
4048	6	A	yeah.
4048	5	B	you know,
4048	5	B	if it's,
4048	4	B	as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know,
4048	4	B	as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, i don't have that big a problem with it.
4048	13	A	now do they fire them, or do they?
4048	21	B	well, see, this is it,
4048	4	B	this is where i start having my problems with my company.
4048	4	B	i work for a private company,
4048	4	B	and
4048	6	A	uh-huh.
4048	7	B	and  the policy is something like, see if i can re-, state this correctly now. if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling.
4048	6	A	uh-huh.
4048	4	B	but if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired.
4048	9	A	oh, wow.
4048	2	B	so, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos.
4048	5	A	huh, that's.
4048	2	A	i think our policy is that,
4048	2	A	all right, it's probably the same thing.
4048	28	A	i'm not really sure what the ,
4048	6	B	yeah,
4048	6	B	really,
4048	2	B	it's one of those things that you read once,
4048	2	B	and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it .
4048	3	A	that's right.
4048	4	A	but i know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,
4048	4	A	but i'm not sure  if --
4048	6	B	yeah.
4048	7	A	if  it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in.
4048	6	B	yeah,
4048	6	B	yeah,
4048	4	B	our company's a little tougher on the second chance.
4048	2	B	i mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, i think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job.
4048	6	A	uh-huh.
4048	4	B	but, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply.
4048	13	A	uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits,
4048	27	B	well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment
4048	5	B	and, you know, it's not,
4048	4	B	i guess i ha-, haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem.
4048	6	A	uh-huh.
4048	2	B	uh, so i gue-, you know, i guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,
4048	4	B	i mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked.
4048	6	A	uh-huh.
4048	2	B	so, uh, i'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the a -s and b -s are going to be in
4048	4	B	and next week,
4048	16	A	<Laughter>.
4048	7	B	c -s and d -s are going to come in .
4048	2	A	you could time it just right.
4048	3	B	yeah,
4048	3	B	right,
4048	3	B	right.
4048	4	A	i know one employee,
4048	4	A	i know, when i was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,
4048	4	A	and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not.
4048	2	A	that'd be just as dangerous.
4048	3	B	yeah.
4048	2	B	well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff.
4048	3	A	huh. that's true.
4048	4	B	you know, i've, i've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case .
4048	6	A	uh-huh.
4048	13	A	do they give any limits on alcohol,
4048	15	A	or is it?
4048	27	B	uh, i don't remember, to tell you the truth.
4048	2	B	i don't think they do.
4048	2	B	um, well, they must,
4048	9	B	i mean, gee whiz.
4048	4	B	that just shows you how much i've been paying attention,
4048	4	B	because i, i really don't know.
4048	16	A	<Laughter>.
4048	4	B	i'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask .
4048	6	A	oh.
4048	2	B	well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far.
4048	4	B	uh, there was a company in houston that,
4048	4	B	they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company
4048	6	A	uh-huh.
4048	4	B	oh, it was, it was, it was an unannounced sweep of, of,
4048	4	B	it was not only drugs,
4072	0	A	okay.
4072	20	A	how do you keep up with current events?
4072	4	B	um, well actually, usually, uh, in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work, uh,
4072	4	B	usually catch the news in the morning.
4072	6	A	yeah,
4072	20	A	what what channel do you watch or what station?
4072	4	B	uh, n b c.
4072	4	A	that's the one i watch.
4072	4	A	i usually keep up with t v.
4072	5	A	i don't,
4072	4	A	i am a student
4072	4	A	so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	4	A	so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't
4072	6	B	yeah.
4072	7	A	too great sometimes .
4072	6	B	yeah,
4072	4	B	i usually tend to just, you know, rely on, you know, t v, uh, again, you know, just through the grapevine just, just to know like, you know like what today's stories are
4072	4	B	and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one.
4072	6	A	yeah.
4072	4	A	the radio doesn't really have much news sometimes.
4072	4	A	the stations i listen to are just mainly music.
4072	6	B	yeah,
4072	2	B	i think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all.
4072	6	A	yeah.
4072	13	A	do you think that t v is, uh, pretty accurate.
4072	13	A	i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized
4072	5	A	or,
4072	27	B	well, what i really don't like about t v, especially local news as compared to like national news is just, uh, it seems, it seems like everything is very spoon feed
4072	2	B	and you know it's, it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom
4072	6	A	yeah.
4072	7	B	or like the news, because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports, you know, is your kid's bus driver smoking crack,
4072	16	A	<Laughter>.
4072	7	B	on the way to school, you know?
4072	6	A	yeah,
4072	5	A	it's
4072	4	A	they mainly go with like popular topics
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	7	A	just not like basic news.
4072	6	B	yeah.
4072	4	B	also, also i have the observation of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press, you know, which only happened like ten times in my life
4072	6	A	huh.
4072	7	B	you know first thing you know for anything of you know  or anything that  actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
4072	6	A	yeah.
4072	4	B	it's something wrong.
4072	5	A	going,
4072	2	A	they're, looks like they're going more for ratings than for
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	7	A	you know actual news.
4072	2	A	i think, you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	2	A	they typically have a better.
4072	4	A	i am from a small town too here in texas
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	7	A	and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato
4072	5	A	and,
4072	6	B	yeah,
4072	24	B	the farm report.
4072	3	A	yeah,
4072	4	A	farm report and oil reports.
4072	16	B	<Laughter>.
4072	9	A	that's pretty pretty sad
4072	4	A	or who killed who.
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	4	B	also i have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television .
4072	4	B	read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down
4072	5	B	and,
4072	6	A	yeah.
4072	4	A	well, in, uh, in dallas, i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into luby's
4072	4	A	and the story was, uh,
4072	13	B	was that like he started shooting people, people in this cafeteria or something?
4072	19	A	yeah.
4072	4	A	and the news covered it
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	7	A	right, you know, hours after it happened
4072	4	A	and they were taping people who were crying who
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	7	A	had everything
4072	4	A	and then like three days later this, uh, local news station was using as as their promo
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	7	A	to promote themselves.
4072	2	A	i just thought that was really # that's kind of cold, #
4072	6	B	# oh yeah,
4072	4	B	i # have seen that happen lots of times.
4072	4	B	you know, uh, channel x gives you the best coverage
4072	4	B	you know we were on the scene with our team players
4072	5	B	and,
4072	6	A	yeah
4072	5	A	and it was just,
4072	4	A	they were showing like these dead people
4072	6	B	uh-huh .
4072	4	A	and they were showing people crying
4072	6	B	uh-huh .
4072	2	A	i mean just taking advantage of you know.
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	0	A	# . #
4072	2	B	# they are trying to get # the, you know, most emotional response for,
4072	3	A	yeah,
4072	4	A	it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story,
4072	4	A	but just the play on people's emotions .
4072	5	A	it's just gotten so,
4072	2	A	i mean, somewhere there's, it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in walter cronkite that if you know --
4072	6	B	yeah .
4072	2	A	and everything.
4072	6	B	yeah,
4072	6	B	yeah.
4072	4	B	you know, i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know
4072	6	A	yeah.
4072	4	B	uh, you know even the national news i just find it to be you know
4072	6	A	yeah.
4072	7	B	very watered down,
4072	5	B	very,
4072	1	A	what did you think of the coverage of the war?
4072	4	B	uh, i fou-, i found it very one sided.
4072	18	A	did you?
4072	2	B	uh, you know, it, it just seemed to lack any sort of debate.
4072	6	A	yeah.
4072	28	B	uh, you know, not saying that we shou-, that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there,
4072	2	B	but it just seemed like, you know.
4072	2	A	they kept just showing, you know, how great we were doing
4072	2	A	and it never really showed  what actually --
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	7	A	the damage that really  happened that's --
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	2	A	a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the, you know, the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	5	A	and they kind of you know,
4072	8	A	if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who
4072	6	B	uh-huh.
4072	7	A	you know got really hurt and everything.
4072	6	B	yeah,
4072	2	B	and i really think that you know in the involvement that the press states, you know that the the military basically sets the press,
4318	0	A	before the one will take,
4318	6	A	uh, okay,
4318	21	A	let's see,
4318	4	A	i guess, uh, i can start.
4318	4	A	i'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because
4318	18	B	are you really?
4318	7	A	our family's growing.
4318	19	A	yeah.
4318	4	A	uh, so i'm looking at, uh, something larger than what we have.
4318	4	A	we've got, like, an eighty-four charger that's about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine horizon.
4318	4	A	so, # i'm looking for something, uh,  littler # --
4318	6	B	# uh-huh,
4318	29	B	which are both kind of small. #
4318	7	A	bigger,
4318	3	A	yeah.
4318	4	A	uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while
4318	4	A	and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans
4318	6	B	uh-huh.
4318	7	A	as well.
4318	13	B	are you looking for an american car
4318	15	B	or, you open to buying foreign cars?
4318	4	A	uh, i don't really have a preference either way i guess.
4318	6	B	uh-huh.
4318	7	A	you know,
4318	5	A	it's, you know, it,
4318	4	A	i guess the american cars had a bad reputation
4318	4	A	but
4318	6	B	uh-huh.
4318	7	A	i haven't had any real substantial problems with the
4318	6	B	right.
4318	7	A	ones i've had.
4318	4	B	personally, i have a japanese car right now,
4318	4	B	and i really like it a lot.
4318	2	B	uh, i think the japanese really build good cars
4318	6	A	uh-huh.
4318	4	B	and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, uh, you know, buy american, keep american auto workers working right now,
4318	2	B	but i feel that the japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, uh, car manufacturers have for a while.
4318	6	A	yeah.
4318	4	B	if i were to buy another car, i would be, uh, i would be partial to buying another japanese car,
4318	4	B	but i would also look at american cars,
4318	4	B	but when i bought the car that i bought now, i did that also
4318	2	B	and i just felt that the japanese car was a much better product.
4318	6	A	yeah,
4318	2	A	i mean,  e-, --
4318	4	B	so, if i were,
4318	7	A	even  if it's just details, it seems like, uh
4318	6	B	right.
4318	7	A	they, you know,
4318	5	A	i j-,
4318	4	A	there's a door seal that s-, doesn't quite seal
4318	4	A	and you have to take it back every once in a while.
4318	4	A	it's clearly just a, a design problem there.
4318	3	B	right,
4318	3	B	it is.
4318	5	B	uh, i'm kind of,
4318	5	B	right now,
4318	4	B	the next car i buy is going to be sort of a sports car.
4318	4	B	i would really like to have a sports car.
4318	4	B	uh , i don't really, i don't have a family,
4318	4	B	so i don't need a, a mini van or such to, uh, haul people around in.
4318	6	A	uh-huh.
4318	4	B	so i'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, uh,
4318	13	A	oh, like a miata or something like that?
4318	21	B	well, i like the miata,
4318	36	B	but i don't like it enough to buy it.
4318	4	B	i would buy something,
4318	4	B	actually the, the car that i really like right now is an eagle talon, which is an american car.
4318	5	A	um.
4318	4	B	but, uh, something along that lines.
4318	9	A	interesting.
4318	4	B	uh, because i have a, an economy car right now, which is okay,
4318	4	B	but
4318	6	A	yeah.
4318	7	B	uh, i think i, i'd like to move on to something a little better.
4318	9	A	that's interesting.
4318	5	A	yeah,
4318	2	A	i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because i look for, you know, size and
4318	6	B	right.
4318	7	A	safety, and then mileage.
4318	5	A	probably,
4318	6	B	right.
4318	5	A	uh,
4318	5	B	that's,
4318	4	B	when i bought the car that i bought, i was looking for mileage,
4318	4	B	and i was looking for, uh, dependability and something that was going to last a long time. i was g-, that i would get a, for the money that i was going to spend, that i would get a return that was, that was worth that money.
4318	6	A	yeah.
4318	5	B	so,
4318	6	A	yeah
4318	4	A	i c-, i think in terms of computer terminology, i look at, you know, price performance and # things like that. #
4318	3	B	# right,
4318	3	B	exactly. #
4318	7	A	and then a little bit at life expectancy, i guess,
4318	2	A	but it, you know
4318	6	B	yeah.
4318	7	A	depends on what you, what you pay initially.
4318	4	A	but, you know
4318	3	B	that's right.
4318	7	A	i've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the charger.
4318	4	A	actually
4318	6	B	uh-huh.
4318	7	A	it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
4318	4	A	and she got just a commute between cincinnati and dayton.
4318	6	B	uh-huh.
4318	5	A	it's, you know,
4318	4	A	we, we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles,
4318	4	A	but
4318	6	B	uh-huh.
4318	7	A	uh, the other ninety four thousand have been just fine ,
4318	16	B	<Sniffing>.
4318	7	A	with it,
4318	5	A	so,
4318	6	B	okay.
4318	7	A	but,  uh,
4318	4	B	uh, i've had, uh, i've had one or two american cars i think,
4318	2	B	and, and they were okay.
4318	4	B	i had a pontiac once
4318	4	B	and, and i never had a problem with it,
4318	4	B	but, uh, my mother had a dodge at one point
4318	4	B	and i, i had driven it a few times
4318	4	B	and i really did not feel that it, that i would buy a dodge
4318	5	A	um.
4318	7	B	j-, just from,
4318	4	B	well, actually, i had a, uh, a dodge omni at one point
4318	6	A	uh-huh.
4318	2	B	and that was, i think, what really prejudiced me against american cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.
4318	6	A	yeah.
4318	2	B	so, i guess you'd have to say, if i was looking, i would definitely be looking for a foreign car.
4318	9	A	that's interesting.
4318	5	A	but,
4318	5	A	yeah,
4318	2	A	it, it's hard to beat some of the,
4318	4	A	uh, like, i guess, in particular, we're looking at a, like a ninety-one corsica, uh, buy back at a, they say g m sponsored auction,
4318	4	A	but i think they're obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that
4318	6	B	uh-huh.
4318	7	A	they can sell it back to g m after, you know, it's, after they've used it for six months and put
4318	6	B	right.
4318	7	A	you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles,
4318	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
4318	7	A	on it
4318	4	A	and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you,
4318	2	B	which is a good deal.
4318	3	A	yeah,
4318	5	A	because i guess, uh,
4318	4	A	i mean, well, ninety-twos, granted, but the new ones, you know --
4318	6	B	uh-huh.
4318	4	A	fourteen to sixteen is what they go for
4318	6	B	right.
4318	7	A	on the lot,
4318	4	A	so all the depreciation has been taken off
4318	4	A	and, s-, the dealer comes out okay
4318	6	B	yeah
4318	5	B	that,
4318	7	A	you know,
4318	4	A	i don't know what kind of, i don't know what g m corporate, kind of hit the, i don't know what kind of hit they take on it,
4318	2	A	but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it
4318	28	A	and ,
4318	3	B	yeah,
4318	2	B	i'm sure they did.
4318	7	A	so,   but,  uh, i don't know,
4318	4	A	we keep looking at that mini van.
4318	5	A	it's just, you know,
4318	4	A	we can get a, like a caravan
4318	6	B	uh-huh.
4318	7	A	for, at twelve, five
4318	6	B	right.
4318	4	A	but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now.
4318	2	A	but, uh, uh, it's interesting,
4318	28	A	but, uh, i don't know,
4318	2	A	if, if, uh, it seems to be,
4321	13	A	well, have you ever served on a jury?
4321	26	B	no,
4321	4	B	i've not.
4321	4	B	i've been called,
4321	4	B	but i had to beg off from the duty.
4321	13	B	and you?
4321	23	A	well, i was called
4321	4	A	and then i was not chosen.
4321	5	B	um.
4321	2	B	well, i was, i was, uh, originally chosen primarily, i think, because i was a young fellow
4321	2	B	and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict.
4321	4	B	i don't know why.
4321	4	B	something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago.
4321	18	A	oh, really?
4321	19	B	yeah,
4321	4	B	it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,
4321	4	B	and they kind of liked me.
4321	4	B	i looked conser-, and all that stuff
4321	5	B	and they,
4321	4	B	i don't know what they saw in me,
4321	4	B	but they saw it.
4321	4	B	but, uh, back to the issue, is, uh,
4321	28	B	i don't know,
4321	2	B	at times i feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun.
4321	2	B	but, there, too, there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, i think in civil cases.
4321	2	B	in criminal cases, i'd like to see the unani-, unanimity remain,
4321	2	B	but in civil cases, i think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient.
4321	1	A	well, uh, could you give me an example of a case where you think that?
4321	2	B	well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such. i think there ought to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this.
4321	4	B	and in civil law there, you know, is such a thing as like, let's say, uh, misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that.
4321	2	B	a majority rule, i think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases.
4321	28	B	i don't know if i'm making any sense or not.
4321	2	A	well, i mean, i think,
4321	13	A	are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, uh, tangible
4321	5	A	or,
4321	19	B	yeah,
4321	2	B	often there's more incriminating evidence.
4321	11	B	like, for instance, say, uh,
4321	2	B	and also, too, i think i'm, i'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, uh, serious in a criminal case.
4321	13	A	well, do you think that, that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up?
4321	21	B	um, well, i really can't say for certain, truth be known.
4321	2	B	uh, as it stands, there's, there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up, both, uh, in a civil, uh, civil and criminal case.
4321	2	B	i mean, the, uh, documentary, the thin blue line pretty much demonstrated that.
4321	13	B	you know, i don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not.
4321	26	A	no,
4321	4	A	i'm not.
4321	4	B	a, uh, fellow when he was much younger, uh, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death.
4321	4	B	fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked
4321	4	B	and, uh, so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system.
4321	4	B	the case was reopened
4321	4	B	and he was exonerated.
4321	2	A	well, i mean, i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served.
4321	3	B	yeah,
4321	2	B	many laws, but little justice.
4321	5	A	say,
4321	5	A	but, uh,
4321	2	A	and i also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, uh, the, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective.
4321	3	B	oh, certainly not,
4321	3	B	certainly not.
4321	2	B	and , you know, they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this,
4321	2	B	but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires.
4321	5	B	you know, the,
4321	4	B	because you get up
4321	4	B	and, and they ask you a few questions,
4321	4	B	both sides do,
4321	4	B	and then you, you're either challenged which is,
4321	4	B	you know, each attorney can use that as much as they like
4321	4	B	or, i think it's a limit now,
4321	2	B	they probably have a limit now,
4321	4	B	but, they pretty much go through that,
4321	4	B	and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve.
4321	4	B	for me, it was financial hardship,
4321	4	B	so. but, onto the thing, uh, i was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing.
4321	4	B	it was always my impression that the justice himself, or herself, had the final say.
4347	0	B	okay,
4347	20	B	so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
4347	4	A	uh, not too bad really.
4347	4	A	uh, i had a razor that i got from christmas that i just, i really didn't want it,
4347	4	A	but i got it anyway
4347	4	A	and, uh, it was a braun
4347	4	A	and they were real good about taking it back.
4347	4	A	it wasn't a problem at all,
4347	4	A	so, uh, i was able to get that back pretty easily.
4347	6	B	uh-huh.
4347	28	A	but, uh, i don't know,
4347	4	A	i really haven't returned a whole lot lately.
4347	13	A	have you?
4347	36	B	i haven't had to.
4347	5	B	it's, uh, the,
4347	5	B	every so often,
4347	4	B	i mean, i, i, i'm almost pushing it myself.
4347	4	B	maybe i'll buy a shirt from g i joe's
4347	4	B	and it shrinks too much
4347	4	B	and say, well, i should have known better,
4347	4	B	i mean, i bought it from g i joe's
4347	6	A	um.
4347	2	B	and it was probably made in china by slaves.
4347	6	A	right .
4347	5	B	but, uh, they, uh,
4347	4	B	most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, i get pretty good stuff.
4347	6	A	yeah.
4347	2	B	i think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized
4347	3	A	right
4347	5	A	like,
4347	2	B	and if you want to buy american , it takes real extra work to find.
4347	3	A	exactly.
4347	2	B	it's probably
4347	5	A	i was reading,
4347	7	B	a japanese or a burmese company owning and hiring people in the u s .
4347	3	A	right,
4347	4	A	i was reading something in, uh, consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact.
4347	4	A	they were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out.
4347	6	B	uh-huh.
4347	7	A	and about how, yeah, you'd like to buy an american car maybe
4347	4	A	but, uh, you know, the transmission may be made in japan or whatever.
4347	6	B	yeah.
4347	4	A	uh, like i've got an eighty-six ford ranger
4347	4	A	and, and i know for a fact that the transmission is made by mitsubishi.
4347	6	B	huh.
4347	8	A	you know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know?
4347	3	B	yeah,
4347	3	B	really.
4347	2	A	but, uh, that's the way it is.
4347	28	A	i don't know,
4347	2	A	i, i personally feel that, uh, uh, if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes
4347	2	A	and, you know, people, man-, more than manufacturers should get a clue
4347	2	A	and, you know, they should start making quality products.
4347	3	B	yeah,
4347	2	B	i think they're beginning to.
4347	2	B	the, the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away
4347	5	B	and,
4347	4	A	that's what i thought, too, until i saw the consumer reports issue.
4347	6	B	uh-huh.
4347	4	A	uh, they've got all the american, well,  all the, all the cars  rated, you know,
4347	2	A	and, uh, essentially, i h-, i don't see much of a trend.
4347	2	A	i mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the honda accords and the civics are right up there.
4347	2	A	there's nothing wrong with them. uh, and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars.
4347	2	A	but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy
4347	2	A	and they're pieces of junk.
4347	3	B	i know.
4347	3	B	still at it, hey.
4347	6	A	yeah,
4347	4	A	that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one.
4347	9	B	wow.
4347	28	A	but, uh, i don't know,
4347	2	A	may-, maybe they're getting better,
4347	2	A	maybe they're starting to get a clue. uh,
4347	4	B	well, they got a three year lead time.
4347	2	B	it probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so .
4347	3	A	yeah,
4347	3	A	that's just it.
4347	2	A	technology that comes in right now is, is probably not going to be imple-, implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road.
4347	5	A	but, uh,
4347	2	B	the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer.
4347	3	A	oh, yeah.
4347	3	A	yeah,
4347	2	A	because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time.
4347	8	B	and can you
4347	6	A	uh,
4347	7	B	think of any other industry where in software they,
4347	2	B	if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail s-, .
4347	6	A	yeah.
4347	2	B	or, uh, maybe i say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade.
4347	6	A	yeah.
4347	16	B	<Laughter>.
4347	5	A	it,
4347	2	A	uh, th-, they keep up c-, with it pretty quickly
4347	2	A	and that's, that's a real good thing, i guess.
4347	6	B	yeah.
4347	28	A	uh, i don't know.
4347	2	B	and the hardware, well, i mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity
4347	2	B	and the macintosh is about the only one that's going right
4347	6	A	yeah.
4347	7	B	forcing i b m and the rest of the d o s world to follow along.
4347	3	A	right,
4347	2	A	they're kind of the leaders right now, you know.
4347	4	A	i used to see all those commercials for windows, you know,
4347	2	A	and you're like,
4347	16	B	<Laughter>.
4347	7	A	oh, gee, they're reselling a macintosh under a different name.
4347	3	B	really,
4347	8	B	why don't they just say, almost a mac for half the price.
4347	6	A	yeah, you know.
4347	2	B	they'd sell more if they were honest.
4347	3	A	exactly,
4347	2	A	almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because i, i really, i've used both
4347	2	A	and i really don't see an advantage of windows at all.
4347	2	B	yeah,  it --
4347	6	A	uh,
4347	7	B	it's  only an advantage for people who had to use pure d o s.
4347	3	A	yeah, yeah that's true, too.
4347	7	B	base.
4347	28	A	but, uh, i don't know,
4347	4	A	i'm really, i've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because i don't have one at home.
4347	4	A	i, i do use a mac at work
4347	4	A	but, uh
4347	6	B	uh-huh.
4347	7	A	uh, i really don't, don't do much with it at home
4347	5	A	but, uh,
4347	2	B	apple's sort of making a s-,
4347	2	B	and they're ones were
4347	2	B	growling consumer, uh, need to worry about the mac they're getting,
4347	4	B	like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had to go back.
4347	4	B	they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with
4347	6	A	right.
4347	7	B	floppy drive.
4347	3	A	uh-huh.
4347	3	A	yeah,
4347	13	A	you sound like you must, uh, work in the computer business.
4347	19	B	yeah,
4347	4	B	i have one,
4347	4	B	i do desktop publishing at work
4347	4	B	and i have a machine at home
4347	4	B	and i belong to the user's group
4347	4	B	and i, i've been a mac fanatic since they came out.
4347	18	A	yeah?
4347	5	A	all right.
4347	4	B	but, uh, technically, i'm not actually in the industry.
4347	4	B	i don't work a computer company.
4347	18	A	no?
4347	4	B	i'm an abuser.
4347	9	A	well, that's, that's all right.
4347	2	B	but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to
4347	3	A	yeah,
4347	3	A	that's true.
4347	7	B	you know, keep up with the changes as they happen.
4347	2	A	something that i find uncomfortable is, you know, you, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer
4347	2	A	and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, you know,
4347	4	A	let, let's take the example, the modem for, you know,
4347	6	B	yeah.
4347	6	A	okay,
4347	8	A	w-, w-, what baud rate do you get?
4347	4	A	well, you know, it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-,
4356	13	A	so. have you heard about saturns?
4356	21	B	i've heard some about saturns.
4356	4	B	i don't know a lot about them.
4356	4	B	i haven't been over, uh, to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their, uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the, i guess, the japanese cars.
4356	0	B	*comment on trans. -? delete line?
4356	9	A	ooh, that's great.
4356	4	A	actually that's kind of the type of car that i, i'm thinking about we might get.
4356	4	A	saturns, you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a, a saturn dealer.
4356	7	B	uh-huh.
4356	7	A	this, this offshoot of g m .
4356	6	B	yeah.
4356	2	A	and, uh, supposedly, they've got great customer satisfaction from what things i've heard.
4356	3	B	um. yeah,
4356	4	B	i've heard a lot of people like them.
4356	4	B	uh, yet i don't know wh-, whether i would buy saturn or not at this point.
4356	5	B	i'm kind of,
4356	2	B	my card and, uh, desires tend to be pretty picky
4356	5	B	and so, uh.
4356	13	A	well, like what?
4356	21	B	well, let's see.
4356	4	B	i li-, i like cars that are designed with, with human beings in mind,
4356	16	A	<Thumping>.
4356	4	B	and that's not just the driver and the passenger
4356	4	B	but that's the person who's working on it,
4356	4	B	cause i do al-, almost all my own maintenance # and, uh #
4356	6	A	# uh-huh. #
4356	7	B	those types of things.
4356	4	B	and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in, uh, finding a ca-, car anymore that's, that's fairly easy for me to work on, it's just not very eas-, it's not very,
4356	2	B	almost unlikely at this point.
4356	6	A	yeah.
4356	5	B	and, uh, yo-,
4356	6	A	yeah.
4356	4	A	i've got a sixty-five mustang
4356	4	A	#  and #
4356	9	B	# ooh. #
4356	7	A	i,  and i  do the work on, most of the work on that myself.
4356	6	B	uh-huh.
4356	4	A	and when i look at modern cars and stuff like that, i just say i will never do that with the modern cars.
4356	2	A	it's not worth my time.
4356	2	A	you can't get in there.
4356	2	A	you can't do anything.
4356	6	B	yeah.
4356	2	A	and it's so complicated too.
4356	4	A	i look at it
4356	4	A	and i say, boy, you know,
4356	4	A	i, i'd have to almost go take a class or something like that.
4356	4	B	well i've got an eighty-three saab.
4356	6	A	uh-huh.
4356	2	B	and i find that for a normal, you know, everyday things. it's really very easy to work on
4356	4	B	and so, uh, you know, i'm kind of spoiled.
4356	4	B	i used to have a chevy.
4356	6	A	# uh-huh. #
4356	4	B	# with a # three fifty in it.
4356	6	A	yeah.
4356	4	B	and, uh, i really liked working on it. uh, cause it was pretty easy too.
4356	4	B	it was about a nineteen seventy.
4356	4	B	so i'm kind of, uh, biased in that
4356	2	B	and, you know, i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore.
4356	6	A	yeah .
4356	2	B	and that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing i'd look at.
4356	2	B	i think another thing i'd look at is safety.
4356	3	A	yeah.
4356	4	A	that's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about.
4356	4	A	actually, the car, one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one ford taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have # dual #
4356	6	B	# huh. #
4356	7	A	side air bags.
4356	2	B	that's a real nice car, i think.
4356	6	A	yeah .
4356	4	B	i've driven some, uh, tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips.
4356	6	A	uh-huh .
4356	7	B	uh, as rental cars.
4356	4	B	and i've always been very impressed with the taurus.
4356	2	B	it's a really nice car.
4356	2	B	i think it's very , it's a stylish car both inside and out.
4356	2	B	it's comfortable to drive.
4356	2	B	uh, reasonable performance,
4356	2	B	and this is out in california where, where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore.
4356	6	A	yeah.
4356	4	B	uh, i've been real impressed with that.
4356	5	B	yo-,
4356	4	B	and i didn't realize that they were putting dual, uh, air bags in that # car now. #
4356	4	A	# ninety,
4356	5	A	yeah. #
4356	4	A	or, excuse me, the ninety-twos. #
4356	4	A	the #
4356	6	B	# uh-huh. #
4356	7	A	ninety-twos had dual air bags.
4356	4	A	this newest model.
4356	4	A	# you could #
4356	2	B	# oh, i think  that, #
4356	7	A	get them with duals .
4356	7	B	that's  excellent.
4356	2	B	that's excellent # because, #
4356	6	A	# yeah. #
4356	4	A	but the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars.
4356	4	A	actually, my, my wife and i are actually thinking, contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so.
4356	4	A	so we're # actually #
4356	6	B	# oh. #
4356	7	A	been looking around and thinking about things.
4356	4	A	we'd like to get like a
4356	28	A	oh, i don't know.
4356	20	A	what do you call it?
4356	4	A	a dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know.
4356	6	B	uh-huh.
4356	4	A	year old ninety-two or something like that.
4356	6	B	uh-huh.
4356	6	B	sure.
4356	5	B	# those are # --
4356	5	A	# see if we, #
4356	6	B	yeah,
4356	2	B	that, that would be a good deal to go with.
4356	4	A	and the other thing we're looking at is the saturns # too. #
4356	6	B	# okay. #
4356	2	A	because they looked really nice.
4356	6	B	uh-huh.
4356	20	B	what do you, what do you looking for in, in those?
4356	20	B	what, what attracts you to the saturns?
4356	4	B	or, or, of course, we've already talked, you know,
4356	2	B	the taurus is safe.
4356	1	B	but wh-, what kind of things are you # looking for? #
4356	4	A	# well, the # saturns you can get air bags in them.
4356	4	A	i don't think you can get dual side air bags.
4356	6	B	uh-huh.
4356	4	A	but one of the, the two things that i'm really,
4356	2	A	the, the i'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart. that doesn't have problems.
4356	6	B	uh-huh.
4356	4	A	you set down.
4356	4	A	you look at consumer reports.
4356	4	A	we've been pouring over consumer reports
4356	2	A	and you just get so depressed for the u s auto
4356	6	B	yeah.
4356	7	A	makers when you do that.
4356	4	A	because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have
4356	4	A	and, and the two cars that apparently are close to that. that actually have high reliability, the taurus is one of the highest u s cars.
4356	6	B	uh-huh.
4356	4	A	and the other one is, are the saturns.
4356	6	B	uh-huh.
4356	4	A	so those two things.
4356	4	A	and then, you know, we kind of want a four door.
4356	6	B	okay .
4372	2	B	so, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order
4372	4	B	and after the fact, the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it.
4372	1	B	what do you think?
4372	13	B	is pennsylvania kind of out of line there?
4372	36	A	well, actually, i don't think they're out of line.
4372	28	A	de-, devil's advocate possibly,
4372	2	A	but it, you are trying to avoid paying taxes
4372	4	A	and whe-, whether or not you agree with that law, i-, you're still circumventing it.
4372	4	A	you are legal in, in your circumvention of that law.
4372	20	B	what, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though?
4372	20	B	i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase mail order?
4372	2	A	really, i, i, i don't think that's a valid argument.
4372	2	A	i think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax.
4372	4	A	um, s-, s-, naturally some, some things you just can't find in your local k-mart or, or, uh, bryn mawr stereo dealer.
4372	8	A	uh, but th-, th-, th-, then why not pay, pay the sales tax .
4372	4	A	corporations have to,
4372	8	A	why should an individual just because it's, just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax?
4372	2	B	well, i mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when i purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania.
4372	4	B	it's because, i'm sorry, the commonwealth of # pennsylvania. #
4372	6	A	# yes. #
4372	2	B	uh, it's because i, i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area.
4372	4	B	so i go outside the area for that.
4372	2	B	and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state.
4372	2	B	i don't, i don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer.
4372	3	A	i, i'll agree it, it's not your responsibility
4372	8	A	but, b-, is it also legal,
4372	16	B	<Rustling> <static>.
4372	7	A	for you to do that?
4372	4	A	w-, w-, fr-, from what i understand from v-, v-, various net readings, i-, i-, it, the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years.
4372	4	A	it is, it is a lost revenue stream right now
4372	2	A	and states c-, can use all the revenue they can get.
4372	13	A	with some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply?
4372	27	B	well, i think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it.
4372	2	B	because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, i bought this out of state.
4372	33	B	i need to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania.
4372	4	A	which is exactly what businesses do at the present.
4372	3	B	right.
4372	2	B	but the point is is that businesses do that.
4372	4	B	the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question.
4372	2	B	that's a cost of doing business.
4372	2	B	the # burden #
4372	4	A	# and  i, i  #
4372	7	B	shouldn't be placed on the consumer.
4372	7	A	i  was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having to pay sales tax on it.
4372	5	B	uh.
4372	4	A	that's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works.
4372	4	A	usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay.
4372	4	A	but the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay.
4372	4	A	and there r-, there are s-, some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that.
4372	13	B	uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a # consumer and #
4372	5	A	# i-, . #
4372	7	B	then being responsible for the sales tax?
4372	26	A	no.
4372	4	A	businesses, uh
4372	7	B	or purchasing.
4372	7	A	if purchasing things mail order,
4372	4	A	if, if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say utah.
4372	4	A	um, i, i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have to pay pennsylvania sales tax.
4372	4	A	my a-, accounting department will at the end of the month.
4372	2	A	i think that i-, i-, i think that's the way things work in pennsylvania.
4372	4	A	and i know they work that way in, uh, say here in d c.
4372	6	B	yeah.
4372	4	B	see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't, i never see that end of the business.
4372	6	A	yeah.
4372	4	B	so, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.
4372	2	B	uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided.
4372	3	A	that's true.
4372	2	A	i-, i-, a r-, a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, i, i forgot that.
4372	4	A	there, there is no well defined mechanism at all
4372	2	A	and, and that it is a a l-, loss. i, i think is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju-, just to do just that in or-, in order to gain the revenue that's being lost.
4372	4	A	uh, i mean, i, i don't know if i agree with that.
4372	5	A	but it, but,
4372	16	B	.
4572	1	A	so, uh, what things do you consider an invasion of privacy?
4572	27	B	ooh, well i don't know.
4572	1	B	what do you think?
4572	27	A	oh, i don't know.
4572	4	A	i had a little bit more time to think about it.
4572	4	A	i was thinking of, like, uh,
4572	28	A	i don't know,
4572	4	A	i was ju-, started to think about all the big, you know, data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports
4572	6	B	uh-huh,
4572	6	B	uh-huh.
4572	7	A	and all those, you know, demographics studies that they do that, um, you know, have, who knows, how much, you know, stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere
4572	28	A	and i don't know,
4572	4	A	i don't know how much the stuff actually, what they actually have in there
4572	2	A	but
4572	6	B	huh.
4572	7	A	i know they use that, i mean they # sell those, #
4572	1	B	# well what about, # uh, required drug testing, uh, as a, uh, condition of employment?
4572	21	A	yeah,
4572	4	A	that was,  that, that was  the other one i was thinking of .
4572	5	A	i think that's, uh,
4572	4	A	i mean i know # drugs are illegal. #
4572	5	B	# it thing # actually.
4572	4	B	uh, i, uh, have worked at texas instruments.
4572	6	A	huh. uh-huh.
4572	4	B	and, uh, they instituted a drug policy there. drug testing policy where they randomly would test, uh, employees
4572	6	A	uh-huh.
4572	4	B	and actually, to tell you the truth, i really did not think much about it.
4572	4	B	i, i hadn't, you know,
4572	4	B	it really didn't relate to me.
4572	8	B	but there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they, they get a false positive, you know, what recourse do you have.
4572	6	A	uh-huh.
4572	2	B	and, also, uh, uh, this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing, this kind of big brother activity
4572	2	B	and yet, uh, a lot of these large corporations such as texas instruments, although they don't admit to it, it's actually, oh, a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure.
4572	6	A	uh-huh.
4572	2	B	so what that means is, to me, that really it's the government that's requiring this,
4572	2	B	although they don't actually e-, execute it themselves, it's really the government that .
4572	2	B	so, in that sense, it, at least, philosophically, it's really borderline legal.
4572	6	A	uh-huh.
4572	2	A	well i, i think the, i think that, you know, a person's competence should be more determined by, you know, their actions and their behavior
4572	2	A	and if they're, you know, if they're on some kind of, you know, contol-, controlled substance then, you know, it kinds of takes away from the job of, you know, the supervisor or manager type person, you know, who is able to evaluate them.
4572	2	A	i think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a, you know, a chemical, # you know, #
4572	8	B	# well, what about # this, uh, aids epidemic now?
4572	2	B	where you find that, uh, uh, you know, certain people are actually  are, are  criminal in their disregard for  it-,
4572	13	A	these people that are carriers and #  don't #
4572	7	B	# others.
4572	5	B	# yeah,
4572	2	B	and
4572	7	A	that don't  reveal it?
4572	7	B	and,  uh, of course, the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't,
4572	16	A	<Sniffing>.
4572	2	B	it, uh, it destroys their libido.
4572	2	A	yeah, tha-, that would be kind of an extreme.
4572	5	B	now, uh, # you know if they ever, #
4572	4	A	# i mean i've # heard of things like, you know, making them, you know, marking them somehow or, you know, or something like that or, you know, putting them all someplace like in a # kind of, #
4572	1	B	# so what # about that as an invasion of privacy?
4572	21	A	yeah.
4572	2	A	wel-, i guess it kind of borders on where, i mean what do you value more. the invasion of, uh, the person's privacy or the possible danger to, you know, other people.
4572	6	B	so really,
4572	29	B	it i-, gets to balancing, uh, personal freedom against, uh, the general welfare
4572	3	A	yeah.
4572	7	B	of society.
4572	2	A	i guess that's alwa-, that's been the big role of government, i guess . # i mean generally. #
4572	2	B	# well, it, it's supposed # to have been.
4572	3	A	yeah
4572	3	A	. yeah.
4572	2	A	well, that's kind of a difficult one to go into.
4572	2	A	i mean that, that particular case.
4572	31	B	(( no,
4572	5	B	it )) ,
4572	2	A	because i mean, there's a lot of people that, uh, i mean they could require, you know, ob-, obligatory aids testing for everyone because i'm, you know, there's a huge part of the population,
4572	2	A	not a huge part but a, you know --
4572	24	B	a growing part.
4572	2	A	the aids population i guess that have it, that don't know they do
4572	6	B	uh-huh.
4572	7	A	are spreading it.
4572	2	A	but, again, to require, you know, such a test and jus-, and then to make, make it is to subject them to, to discrimi-, discriminatory practices and other things.
4572	28	A	i don't know,
4572	4	A	uh, i don't know how exactly i feel about that.
4572	2	B	maybe chop their weenies off.
4633	20	B	how many children do you have now?
4633	4	A	well i have five.
4633	32	B	you have five?
4633	3	A	right.
4633	13	B	well you do have a hard time finding time # then don't you? #
4633	4	A	# well, # five are, i mean four of them are grown,
4633	4	A	they're in college or just out of college
4633	4	A	so i really have just a thirteen year old at home.
4633	6	B	uh-huh.
4633	2	B	you sound so young.
4633	4	A	well, i work at it # . #
4633	14	B	# # all right .
4633	5	B	to have them, uh,
4633	4	A	i try to fool everybody # . #
4633	2	B	# # i think you're doing a good job.
4633	16	A	# . #
4633	4	B	# i just # have one child.
4633	6	A	uh-huh.
4633	5	B	and, uh, i don't think, uh,
4633	4	B	well there's not much i can do about it.
4633	4	B	my, my wife and i are, u-, in our forties, you know,
4633	5	B	so, uh --
4633	6	A	uh-huh.
4633	2	B	but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the, they're the pivot point of the universe.
4633	3	A	i think you are right
4633	4	A	because i was an only child too.
4633	4	A	and that's one reason i have so many because i really, i enjoy the big family.
4633	6	B	yeah.
4633	4	A	and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters
4633	4	A	and so she is sort of like an only child
4633	2	A	and it's the same type of thing, # uh, #
4633	6	B	# uh-huh.
4633	4	B	# i have a younger brother like that.
4633	4	B	i'm in my forties, like i say
4633	4	B	and i have a brother in his twenties.
4633	6	A	uh-huh.
4633	4	B	and i was, i was the youngest.
4633	6	A	yeah.
4633	4	B	so i understand how that worked.
4633	4	B	and he was treated like he had five fathers # or something. #
4633	3	A	# right.
4633	4	A	# that's exactly how it is, you know.
4633	4	A	she's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her.
4633	4	A	when things don't go right, she just calls one of them, you know.
4633	6	B	yeah.
4633	5	A	but, uh, yeah,
4633	4	A	it, it's a little bit difficult, though.
4633	4	A	i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more. #
4633	5	A	and, #
4633	13	B	# did # you all do a lot of organized things like, uh, little league, uh, # soccer? #
4633	36	A	# we, # we really did not.
4633	4	A	my next oldest daughter that's in college in california is a world twirling champion.
4633	4	A	she twirls a baton
4633	4	A	and we did a lot of things together.
4633	6	B	uh-huh.
4633	4	A	she and i did a lot of things together and flew,
4633	4	A	we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform.
4633	6	B	uh-huh.
4633	4	A	and that was a lot of fun.
4633	2	A	but that, that, i guess you could consider that organized.
4633	2	A	i mean, there is a competition all the time.
4633	6	B	yeah.
4633	4	A	we were very heavy into that.
4633	4	A	other than that, they were pretty much,
4633	4	A	and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.
4633	2	B	you know, i think that's probably true. the,
4633	2	B	if you have one child or fewer, you get involved in organized events or
4633	6	A	uh-huh.
4633	7	B	activities
4633	2	B	and if you have a large number of children or, then you don't.
4633	2	A	well, you can't afford to.
4633	3	B	no,
4633	5	B	you ca-,
4633	2	B	and there's not enough time, # uh #
4633	3	A	# right. #
4633	4	B	like my son is in, uh, little league this year.
4633	4	B	he's ten.
4633	4	B	and they practice three times a week
4633	4	B	and they have a game
4633	2	B	and it's just, uh, if there were more than one child, i don't know, the-, there would be no way to do it.
4633	3	A	right.
4633	3	A	# that's right. #
4633	2	B	# you know, # one parent go one direction
4633	2	B	and i'd have to go in the other
4633	2	B	and
4633	6	A	uh-huh.
4633	7	B	we could only cover two at that.
4633	6	A	yeah.
4633	4	A	well i know i spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter
4633	4	A	and my little one also competed because really she had no choice.
4633	4	A	she had to go with me.
4633	6	B	uh-huh.
4633	4	A	so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and, and competing
4633	2	A	and, of course, the competing itself, really didn't matter what it was,
4633	2	A	it was making the friends and going all the places
4633	4	A	and it was a really neat experience,
4633	4	A	but it took our total time.
4633	4	A	i did not work, uh, when i did this.
4633	4	A	now i do work full-time.
4633	6	B	uh-huh.
4633	4	A	and it's just,
4633	16	B	<Throat_clearing>.
4633	7	A	my thirteen year old and myself
4633	4	A	and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other.
4633	5	A	# so , #
4633	2	B	# i don't # think, although i-, i-,
4633	2	B	i think a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me
4633	2	B	but i'm not sure i could afford three.
4633	2	B	i most certainly couldn't educate three.
4633	16	A	<Laughter>.
4633	4	B	i don't know how my, my parents did it.
4633	6	A	yeah.
4633	4	B	i mean, there were five of us
4633	4	B	and i don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular.
4633	4	B	uh, but i don't know how my father did it.
4633	4	B	he worked at a truck line
4633	4	B	and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children.
4633	4	B	but we did okay.
4633	4	B	we had a house and a home and,
4633	4	B	but now, my wife and i both work
4633	4	B	and we don't, i don't believe we have as much as my parents did
4633	4	B	and we only have one child.
4633	18	A	really?
4633	6	B	uh-huh.
4633	2	A	well, things cost a lot more.
4633	4	A	i don't know how it is in georgia
4633	6	B	huh.
4633	2	A	and i don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some.
4633	4	B	atlanta is horrible.
4633	13	A	is it?
4633	19	B	yes.
4633	4	B	ha-, we have a lot of people moving here from boston and, and different areas
4633	4	B	and from talking to them, they're shocked.
4633	18	A	really?
4633	5	B	wha-,
4633	5	B	and they, you know,
4633	4	B	the housing is so cheap
4633	6	A	right.
4633	7	B	in comparison to boston
4633	3	A	# that's what i've heard. #
4633	7	B	# that they jump # on it.
4633	4	B	they sell their house,
4633	4	B	they stash away a good bit of money and come down here
4633	4	B	and i work with a lot of them,
4633	4	B	they, they think they, they have really done something.
4633	4	B	then when they get down here, they realize the cost of living is outrageous
4633	6	A	huh.
4633	7	B	compared to, to where they came # from. #
4633	6	A	# yeah. #
4633	4	B	the housing is cheaper,
4633	4	B	but that's about it.
4633	39	A	i'm surprised to hear that.
4633	2	A	i've heard very positive things about atlanta,
4660	0	A	okay.
4660	20	A	how do you get your news mostly?
4660	4	B	generally, i get most of my news from, uh, the radio.
4660	4	B	and then sometimes, uh, if i've got time, i'll be reading the front page of the newspaper
4660	6	A	uh-huh,
4660	6	A	# uh-huh. #
4660	7	B	# and # just fall off on the articles that i like.
4660	6	A	uh-huh.
4660	4	B	uh, also, since my wife likes to watch t v, sometimes, uh, ju-, having b-, just being there i get, uh, you know, i have to watch the news late at night
4660	6	A	uh-huh.
4660	7	B	with t v.
4660	6	A	uh-huh,
4660	6	A	uh-huh.
4660	1	B	how about you?
4660	4	A	well, i can hardly wait for my morning paper to come.
4660	6	B	uh-huh
4660	16	B	<laughter>.
4660	4	A	so that's the first thing i want is the headlines.
4660	4	A	it's really funny because because, uh, uh, my sister grabs the sports and i grab the headlines .
4660	6	B	uh-huh.
4660	4	A	but, uh, and then when five o'clock comes around i just want to get in the house and turn the t v on to watch the news.
4660	5	B	um.
4660	2	A	it's really weird.
4660	4	A	uh, i don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long.
4660	4	A	but, uh, i love to watch the five o'clock news
4660	4	A	and i, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where i can read my paper .
4660	5	B	um.
4660	4	A	uh, i do have my radio going most of the day though,
4660	4	A	so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, you know.
4660	6	B	okay.
4660	13	B	# do you #
4660	5	A	# but, #
4660	7	B	get wh-, like one of the talk stations, the news stations?
4660	26	A	no.
4660	26	A	uh-huh. /*listen; mistranscribed 'uh-uh'
4660	4	A	jus-, i just have a channel that has music except for, like every hour, you know, say eight o'clock, # nine #
4660	6	B	# sure. #
4660	7	A	o'clock, they come on for just a little bit of the news.
4660	6	B	right.
4660	4	A	but as far as the actual news, i get that from  from the,
4660	13	A	can you hold on just for a second?
4660	23	B	sure.
4660	11	A	just a minute.
4660	25	A	. hello sir .
4660	25	B	yes.
4660	25	A	yes,
4660	10	A	i'm sorry to keep you waiting # . #
4660	40	B	# okay # .
4660	4	A	uh, i was calling from work
4660	4	A	so and that was a call waiting.
4660	6	B	right.
4660	2	B	s-, it sounds like you, uh, like the news a lot more than i do.
4660	2	B	me, i figure if it's something really important, somebody will tell me about it.
4660	4	B	but, uh, you know, i, the thing is  if, if i  catch the news all the time, it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news.
4660	4	B	# or that's what #
4660	6	A	# yeah,
4660	5	A	yo-, #
4660	7	B	comes on first.
4660	3	A	that's true too.
4660	4	B	and, uh, you know, also late at night, you know, i don't wa-, like watching the news late at night
4660	4	B	but my wife is usually up then #
4660	4	B	and so #
4660	6	A	# uh-huh. #
4660	7	B	i can't go to sleep with the t v on.
4660	6	A	uh-huh,
4660	6	A	uh-huh.
4660	5	B	i, uh,
4660	4	B	but, you know, i, i wish i had, uh, more news on things like, that i consider long range. things like science and medicine
4660	6	A	uh-huh.
4660	4	B	uh, i'm more, i guess i'm more into science and science fiction
4660	5	B	and, uh, there's, you know,
4660	28	B	not that the news is science fiction,
4660	4	B	but, uh, uh, i'm more interested in that.
4660	4	B	things like, uh, is nasa ready for another space shot. uh, you know, how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer
4660	6	A	uh-huh.
4660	4	B	and, uh, uh, you know, a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me.
4660	6	A	yeah.
4660	2	A	well, you're right.
4660	2	A	there is a lot of it that's, that's just garbage, as far as i'm concerned, you know.
4660	6	B	uh-huh.
4660	4	A	but i just like the, more or less, the, the daily news, you know.
4660	6	B	yeah.
4660	7	A	just, uh, especially the weather.
4660	4	A	i like that # . #
4660	4	B	# me, too. #
4660	2	A	although they're usually wrong # . #
4660	3	B	# # yeah,
4660	2	B	georgia here, they're usually wrong too.
4660	2	B	we have weird weather systems.
4660	6	A	uh-huh.
4660	4	A	but, uh, like i say, as far as, as actually listening to the news, it's mostly t v, five o'clock to six thirty.
4660	2	A	uh, that seems like a long time for news
4660	4	A	but that's how long it is.
4660	6	B	yeah.
4660	4	A	and, uh, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news.
4660	6	B	uh-huh.
4660	4	A	and then, uh, my morning paper. i can hardly wait for it to come.
4660	6	B	yeah.
4660	5	B	# i'm #
4660	5	A	# and, uh, #
4660	7	B	you know, i, i just, uh, i would,
4660	4	B	i, i, i'm not a morning person
4660	4	B	so i would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my # morning news. #
4660	16	A	# . #
4660	4	B	i get up just barely in time to get up, get ready and get off to work
4660	4	B	and then # at work #
4660	6	A	# oh. #
4660	7	B	i have no time to read the news.
4660	3	A	yeah,
4660	3	A	right.
4660	4	A	once you get to work, i wouldn't either,
4660	3	A	huh-uh.
4660	6	B	no .
4660	4	A	but i've always been a morning person to get up, you know.
4660	6	B	uh-huh.
4660	4	A	an-, but i can't stay up late at night to watch the late news
4660	4	A	so . i guess that's why i watch it at five o'clock .
4660	6	B	yeah.
4660	12	A	but anyhow. well, listen, i guess that's about it then.
4660	12	B	okay.
4660	12	A	it's been nice talking to you tony.
4660	12	B	nice talking to you.
4660	2	B	i'll probably talk to you again.
4660	4	B	i had a friend who was in this
4660	4	B	and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes.
4660	18	A	oh, really?
4660	19	B	yeah.
4660	4	A	oh, well that hasn't happened to me yet.
4660	28	A	so, you never know,
4660	2	A	it might this time.
4660	3	B	that's right.
4660	12	A	okay, tony.
4660	12	B	take it easy.
4660	12	A	uh-huh.
4660	12	A	# bye-bye. #
4660	12	B	# bye-bye . #
4660	16	A	<Clicking> </talking>.
4697	4	A	well, th-, the question was talking about the juries
4697	4	A	and, uh, one of the things i thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having, that, especially for repeat offenders that, uh,
4697	2	A	maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again.
4697	2	A	uh, so that, uh, a judge, i think, would be the most appropriate person to, uh, to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day.
4697	3	B	right.
4697	2	B	i, i kind of agree with that,
4697	0	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	because i think in some cases, uh, the jury may not even have,
4697	7	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	the information about other crimes the person has committed.
4697	7	A	right. / *slash error should be 'aa'
4697	2	B	uh, i, i think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case
4697	3	A	right .
4697	2	B	so a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal
4697	6	A	uh-huh.
4697	7	B	there
4697	2	B	and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri-, position to give an appropriate, uh, sentencing.
4697	3	A	yeah.
4697	3	A	see i agree with you.
4697	4	A	uh, one thing i heard was this, where they have, instead of going to the regular court, they have a, a mock court.
4697	4	A	i mean, it's supposed to be all legal and everything.
4697	4	A	uh, you go
4697	4	A	and you present your case,
4697	4	A	the other side presents their case
4697	4	A	and you're done with it.
4697	4	A	it's almost like the night court we see on t v.
4697	6	B	uh-huh.
4697	5	A	uh, and, uh, but it's not that we have, uh, such,
4697	4	A	it didn't backlog or all of the, uh, the cases that are, uh, all ready pending.
4697	5	A	uh, so i,
4697	2	A	that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way.
4697	5	B	in other words,  not,
4697	0	A	<Buzz>.
4697	7	B	not,
4697	13	B	there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial?
4697	7	A	yes.
4697	19	A	yes.
4697	5	A	# now, #
4697	39	B	# i, i, # i don't,
4697	31	B	th-, there's a point on which we don't agree.
4697	6	A	uh-huh.
4697	2	B	i would tend, myself, to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a, anytime  a, one  of the parties wants one.
4697	6	A	uh-huh.
4697	2	B	and i, usually it is the defendant, i guess, that wants to have the jury hear the case.
4697	6	A	sure.
4697	2	B	so i'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, uh,
4697	16	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	take that, you know,
4697	2	B	that would require a change in the bill of rights, i believe #
4697	5	B	and so, #
4697	7	A	# oh, yes / *slash error should be aa
4697	4	A	and, and # i wasn't, i didn't mean that # . #
4697	14	B	# oh, oh, okay. #
4697	4	A	i, i didn't mean that, no.
4697	2	A	because, i mean, gee whiz, if i was, uh, uh, didn't have that right, you know, not to have a jury that, oh
4697	2	A	yes, i would feel, uh, you're right, that my civil rights had been violated.
4697	2	A	but i meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here.
4697	2	A	we're not going to have a jury, you know,
4697	2	A	let's get it over with.
4697	2	A	sort of like car accidents, # you know, #
4697	3	B	# right. #
4697	2	B	well i think that's all ready possible.
4697	6	A	yeah.
4697	2	B	i think,
4697	16	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	that you can waive the right to a,
4697	7	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	jury trial # uh,
4697	5	B	yeah #
4697	7	A	# right, / *slash error should be 'aa'
4697	3	A	right . #
4697	3	B	so. i agree that that should be encouraged.
4697	6	A	uh-huh.
4697	2	B	people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial.
4697	2	B	but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to, to clients unless they feel they can, you know, tweak a jury into # #
4697	3	A	# right.
4697	24	A	giving a different sentence. #
4697	7	B	per-, giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, uh, you know, awards of money or something
4697	6	A	uh-huh.
4697	7	B	since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, # the award. #
4697	2	A	# the take. #
4697	3	A	right.
4697	3	B	yeah.
4697	5	B	and i suspect it, in cases like,
4697	4	B	i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil.
4697	13	B	is that right?
4697	27	A	well, i, i, i-, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme.
4697	6	B	yeah.
4697	6	A	uh-huh.
4697	2	B	well, uh, in the case of,
4697	16	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	civil, uh, things, i think maybe the, the use of the jury is very,
4697	7	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	often to the lawyer's advantage
4697	2	B	and i think that may be where jury use is overdone,
4697	7	A	. *slash error
4697	2	B	i mean there are cases where they could be settled,
4697	7	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	# maybe #
4697	7	A	# right. # / *slash error should be 'aa'
4697	7	B	out of court a little more # efficiently. #
4697	3	A	# right. #
4697	5	B	but the lawyers are really, uh,
4697	2	B	it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience ,
4697	16	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	as possible
4697	7	A	uh-huh. / *slash error should be 'b'
4697	4	B	so. uh, i was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases
4697	6	A	uh-huh.
4697	7	B	not just sentencing in, in a criminal cases.
4697	6	A	uh-huh.
4697	2	B	uh, i'm not so sure i'm in favor of that.
4697	2	B	but i am in favor of it for criminal cases #
4697	4	B	so there's a difference of my view there for those two. #
4697	3	A	# right.
4697	3	A	right.
4697	3	A	yeah,
4697	4	A	bu-, well you can tell i # haven't been in too many juries , judges chambers or anything like that .
4697	13	B	have you ever had to serve jury duty?
4697	26	A	n-,
4697	27	A	well i was called once when i was nineteen
4697	6	B	uh-huh.
4697	4	A	and, uh, but i was doing so many other things that they took pity on me
4697	4	A	and, i was doing school and things like
4697	4	A	they, they let me out.
4697	6	B	uh-huh.
4697	4	A	an-, i've never had to it since
4697	4	A	and that was almost twenty years ago # . #
4697	6	B	# uh-huh. #
4697	5	B	it isn't,
4697	4	B	sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time,
4697	16	A	. *slash error
4697	7	B	in, uh,
4697	4	B	that would have been about, uh, twenty years too --
4697	7	A	uh-huh. / *slash error
4697	4	B	uh, uh, just last year
4697	4	B	and, uh, the case i heard was a criminal case
4697	4	B	and it seemed it really,
4697	0	A	<Child_talking>.
4697	7	B	trivial.
4697	4	B	it involved two bicycles.
4697	7	A	uh-huh.
4697	4	B	we didn't do the sentencing.
4697	4	B	the judge did.
4697	6	A	huh.
4697	5	B	so --
4697	9	A	how interesting.
4697	4	B	we, we a-, rendered a verdict
4697	4	B	and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing.
4697	6	A	uh-huh,
4697	6	A	uh-huh .
4697	4	B	and that was here in wisconsin.
4697	4	B	so i, i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it,
4707	0	B	not very good
4707	4	B	# it's not been a good day . #
4707	4	A	# #  i went,
4707	16	B	<Noise> <TV>.
4707	7	A	i turned  mine in about twelve hours early at noon.
4707	28	B	i don't know.
4707	4	B	i finished mine up about eleven and left it here with carolyn
4707	4	B	so i hope she's turned it in.
4707	13	A	are you eating?
4707	5	B	uh, i ju-,
4707	11	B	go ahead,
4707	4	B	i'll stop eating.
4707	4	B	# i just barely got #
4707	5	A	# no it's, #
4707	7	B	home from the university.
4707	32	A	say what?
4707	4	B	i just barely got home from the university.
4707	37	A	tell you what we can do is, uh, i can punch the, uh, one,
4707	16	B	<Noise>.
4707	37	A	and then w-, after five minutes when the, uh, uh, voice comes on, we can talk all night if we want # . #
4707	3	B	# # okay,
4707	11	B	go ahead, #
4707	11	B	fire away. #
4707	4	A	# . # uh, i love the irony of, uh, talking about this subject on april the,
4707	16	B	<Talking>.
4707	7	A	fifteenth .
4707	2	A	but, uh, i'm afraid i'm, i'm probably in the minority.
4707	2	A	i, i actually don't think that we, uh, pay too much in this country. uh
4707	3	B	i agree with you .
4707	7	A	uh, particularly, uh, in this part of the country w-,
4707	2	A	uh, i guess i do have a, a bone to pick with, uh, uh, the way taxes are distributed .
4707	4	A	uh, i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form
4707	5	B	huh.
4707	4	A	and the sales tax can't.
4707	2	A	i think that's regressive
4707	2	A	and, uh, uh, it's kind of dumb.
4707	4	B	i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax.
4707	4	B	but, on the other hand, i don't mind that it's only on, you know, things that aren't like groceries and that,
4707	4	B	it's not on that.
4707	2	A	well, i mean, nobody taxes # groceries. #
4707	31	B	# oh, yeah,
4707	4	B	# they do.
4707	20	A	where?
4707	4	B	in arizona.
4707	13	A	is that right?
4707	19	B	uh-huh.
4707	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
4707	2	B	but we have a pretty low income ta-, i mean pretty low tax rate here.
4707	2	B	oh, i think the, the sales tax, they just got to do something about it.
4707	6	A	right.
4707	2	B	but that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes.
4707	6	A	right .
4707	4	A	but i guess when i hear, when i see the comparison between the united states and, uh, any other western country, uh, their, their rates are like, uh, forty-one, forty-two and ours are like thirty-six, thirty-seven, you know,
4707	2	A	if you compute as a percentage of total income, all taxes lumped together, we actually do pretty well.
4707	4	A	t-, th-, there's no other country that's, that is taxed as low as we are.
4707	2	B	well and i still think that, having lived in europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions
4707	6	A	yeah.
4707	7	B	are certainly well worth, uh, what we pay for it.
4707	6	A	uh-huh.
4707	4	A	i'm, i'm not sure i understand what you mean.
4707	2	B	well, i mean, i think,
4707	4	B	i was in germany, you know, for several years
4707	6	A	right.
4707	2	B	and i'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have, then have to live there.
4707	29	A	oh, you mean, lowest end of living in spite of lower, # higher taxes.
4707	5	A	yeah. #
4707	4	B	# higher taxes.
4707	3	B	# yeah.
4707	2	A	i suppose that's true,
4707	3	A	yeah.
4707	2	A	uh, probably m-, less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever
4707	5	A	but,
4707	2	B	still's that # way to some extent. #
4707	6	A	# # yeah.
4707	2	B	i think the other problem is, you know, it, it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you, theoretically, can do something about.
4707	6	A	right.
4707	5	B	but i look, for example,
4707	4	B	and you're not quite in the same situation
4707	2	B	but like school taxes for me
4707	6	A	right.
4707	7	B	biggest bargain in the world.
4707	4	B	i wish i didn't have to pay any more fo-, to my physicians in a year
4707	6	A	right.
4707	7	B	than i had to pay for all of my school taxes.
4707	6	A	yeah.
4707	6	A	yeah,
4707	4	A	since, uh, i send my kids to parochial school, that # . #
4707	6	B	# yeah,
4707	2	B	that, that's # probably a little tougher on you .
4707	3	A	it's not, it's not quite the bargain that # . #
4707	16	B	# . #
4707	4	A	but, i mean, i pay them gladly.
4707	4	A	that's a decision,
4707	2	A	i think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like canada and england and germany do perfectly well with a, uh, two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f-, with the same tax money.
4707	2	A	but, uh, i mean, that's, that's the way americans want to interpret it,
4707	2	A	i guess that's all right .
4707	5	A	but,
4707	5	A	yeah.
4707	5	A	i,
4707	16	B	<Sniffing>.
4707	5	A	and if i were, uh,
4707	4	A	when i was single and again when i'm retired,
4707	16	B	<Tapping>.
4707	7	A	i will not mind paying, uh, what it takes to keep the schools good.
4707	4	A	that's always been a high priority .
4707	31	B	no,
4707	2	B	i think that's just you though.
4707	5	A	i do,
4707	3	A	yeah,
4707	3	A	that's true.
4707	2	A	#  i think in places, #
4707	16	B	# . #
4707	7	A	i think in places  like california, people are beginning to find that in, in areas that are fairly well off, if you add the, uh, uh, people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those are, uh, just looking for fun, th- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get a tax bill passed no matter what happens.
4707	6	B	yeah.
4707	2	A	and, uh, # , #
4707	16	B	# . #
4707	7	A	there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done.
4707	2	A	that seems a, a, like a cultural lapse.
4707	2	A	i mean, people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools.
4707	5	A	they,
4707	2	B	of course, i think with the graying of america, we're going to see that problem in lots of places.
4707	3	A	right.
4707	3	A	yeah.
4707	2	A	people would rather, uh, increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them.
4707	2	A	but i think it's sad
4707	24	B	or build roads.
4707	7	A	selfish and shortsighted.
4707	3	A	yeah.
4707	16	B	<Throat_clearing> </noise>.
4707	5	A	well,
4716	0	A	okay.
4716	4	A	um, i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten, i guess,
4716	16	B	<Noise>.
4716	7	A	i would rate it a five in the aspect that i wouldn't want everybody to have guns
4716	2	A	and i think there should be limitations of, like semiautomatics.
4716	2	A	uh, things like that should not be just given out to anybody.
4716	2	A	in fact, you know, i can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose.
4716	2	A	uh,
4716	16	B	<Noise>.
4716	7	A	so i guess, you know, being that i come from a hunting family
4716	6	B	uh-huh.
4716	7	A	i'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles, uh, things that people would use for sporting type of, uh, a, activity.
4716	2	A	those would be fine
4716	4	A	but when you get into a, a lot of the more complex weapons, i would say yes
4716	2	A	we need to put restrictions on them .
4716	3	B	uh, that's pro-, i probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way i think.
4716	6	A	uh-huh.
4716	2	B	uh, i definitely think that there, some things shouldn't be limited like, like you said, rifles and
4716	6	A	uh-huh.
4716	7	B	uh, hunting rifles and possible handguns for people who use them # to, #
4716	3	A	# exactly,
4716	2	A	# for self-protection,
4716	3	A	sure.
4716	3	B	right.
4716	2	B	and, but i think the, i think semiautomatic weapons, people say they use them because it, for sport.
4716	2	B	but i, i personally cannot # see any use for them #
4716	9	A	# i can't imagine that.
4716	3	A	yeah. #
4716	7	B	other than, uh, for, for, like people who dislike have some sort of crazed
4716	6	A	uh-huh.
4716	7	B	you know, ambition to use, have high powered weapons or something.
4716	2	A	to do massive amounts of killing, uh,
4716	3	B	right.
4716	5	B	# and #
4716	6	A	# yeah. #
4716	7	B	i mean, you can only, how much # do you wa-, #
4716	2	A	# the only # thing that i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is, uh, uh, you know, going to kill a massive amount of people or, uh, somebody that's escaping, that's, uh, very dangerous
4716	6	B	uh-huh.
4716	2	A	semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and, and, uh, get him down.
4716	6	B	right.
4716	4	A	but, uh, you know, i, i think of my family.
4716	4	A	uh, they're very much into sporting and, uh, you know, as far as hunting and also like, uh, clay pigeons
4716	6	B	right.
4716	7	A	things like that.
4716	6	B	uh-huh.
4716	4	A	so they have may have some shotguns.
4716	4	A	they may have other type of, uh, hunting type things,
4716	2	A	but i figured if the, if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody, more than likely, somebody would see it, you know # what i'm saying #
4716	3	B	# right,
4716	3	B	yeah. #
4716	7	A	versus a, you know, a small handgun, # uh, #
4716	3	B	# yeah,
4716	3	B	that's # true.
4716	7	A	that can be, you know, put right in your coat pocket
4716	2	A	and nobody would see it,
4716	16	B	<Clanging>.
4716	2	A	but yet, you can't stop people from having, you know, a handgun in their home.
4716	6	B	right.
4716	2	A	even if there are small children around,  there's,  you know,
4716	16	B	<Clanging>.
4716	7	A	you can't  say people with small children can't have guns
4716	6	B	uh-huh.
4716	2	A	and people without small children that may have grandchildren, # you know #
4716	6	B	# yeah. #
4716	7	A	still have these guns
4716	4	A	but
4716	6	B	right.
4716	7	A	uh, i guess i, i was always taught,
4716	16	B	<Clanging>.
4716	7	A	number one, a gun isn't a toy.
4716	6	B	right.
4716	4	A	uh, you know, and i don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you, # you know #
4716	6	B	# uh-huh. #
4716	7	A	and don't ever play with it.
4716	6	B	right.
4716	4	A	uh, so i don't know if that makes a difference or what
4716	5	A	but,
4716	2	B	well, i think par-, uh, in that ca-, i think that cases like that it's definitely, um, i think if you're to say okay,
4716	2	B	we have to get rid of them all because
4716	6	A	uh-huh.
4716	7	B	you know, they can only, they only seem to do bad, it, it's, uh, # it's saying we're t-, #
4716	2	A	# the criminals # would get them. i mean even if they had to go across # border to get them. #
4716	3	B	# right,
4716	3	B	right.
4716	2	B	# and people who, people who have them and are responsible with them are, are, are being punished
4716	2	B	and people who --
4716	6	A	uh-huh.
4716	7	B	and they're saying that people  you cannot take care of things yourself or like that you're not smart enough to teach your kids how to, how to, uh, # . #
4716	24	A	# how to use, # you know, to make sure the guns are put up  as something  # as #
4716	6	B	# right. #
4716	7	A	uh, not a toy.
4716	6	B	right .
4716	6	A	yeah.
4716	4	A	because we had guns all over our house when we were kids
4716	6	B	uh-huh.
4716	4	A	and not that they were laying on the, uh, couch or anything like that
4716	6	B	right.
4716	4	A	but, uh, i never had an interest in them,
4716	16	B	<Clanging>.
4716	7	A	being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill
4716	6	B	uh-huh.
4716	4	A	and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns
4716	6	B	right.
4716	4	A	and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy
4716	6	B	right.
4716	4	A	and, of course , we were quite young
4716	4	A	and we went through,
4716	16	B	<Clanging>.
4716	7	A	uh, the national rifle, uh, club
4716	6	B	uh-huh.
4716	4	A	and so we were taught, you know, kind of at a, a good age, ten and eleven and twelve, to sit down with a kid and say okay,
4716	33	A	if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun, you're going to learn how to do it correctly
4716	33	A	and you're going to learn how to have safeguards  and --
4716	6	B	uh-huh.
4716	7	A	and  know how to protect yourself
4716	2	A	but yet have this,
4716	16	B	<Clanging>.
4716	7	A	training so that kids aren't , you know,
4716	2	A	they have to have a certain respect for it.
4716	3	B	right.
4716	4	B	well i think, i mean  we, i grew up  in a family
4716	4	B	and, and my father had two guns
4716	6	A	uh-huh.
4716	4	B	because he used to hunt years ago
4716	4	B	but
4716	6	A	sure.
4716	7	B	he stopped before, really before i was old enough to remember.
4716	6	A	uh-huh.
4716	4	B	but, and i knew we had the guns in the house
4716	4	B	and, th-, the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time
4716	6	A	sure,
4716	6	A	yeah.
4716	4	B	but we, it was never, my brothers, sisters nor i never, i mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun
4716	4	B	or let's go get the gun
4716	4	B	it was just something you knew was there
4716	6	A	yes.
4716	4	B	and th-, it was your father's
4716	4	B	and y-, you, that was not something you'd go and play, played with at all
4716	6	A	yeah.
4716	2	B	and i think maybe, uh, and that's the type of, the thing that should be, # you know, stressed. #
4716	3	A	# yeah,
4716	3	A	i think so
4716	4	A	an-, and i # don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what ,
4736	4	A	capital punishment, uh, i guess, out in california is, has had a lot of, uh, a lot of, you know, discourse in the paper.
4736	4	A	uh, apparently, you know, there's, they haven't, uh, executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven, i believe.
4736	6	B	uh, yeah.
4736	4	B	that's, that's as far back as i can remember .
4736	4	B	# well, that's before #
4736	6	A	# yeah,
4736	5	A	they, #
4736	7	B	my time actually.
4736	4	A	well, i, we were, we, uh, we just started, we lived in redwood city when we were out there.
4736	6	B	uh-huh.
4736	4	A	and, uh, and we found that, uh you know, it was a very liberal kind of community.
4736	2	A	but the, uh, i, i really feel that, that the law enforcement community, uh, you know, puts these people behind bars
4736	2	A	and then they, they, uh, uh, you know, lawyers, these lawyer groups get together
4736	2	A	and they, uh, they, i think, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process. uh, you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh, demise out for ten or fifteen years.
4736	2	A	uh, and i, i think that, uh, that there's something that has to be changed in the system to, to do that.
4736	2	A	i think capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough
4736	2	A	but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way.
4736	6	B	uh-huh.
4736	13	A	do, do you feel as though there should be, uh, more, uh,  was or, or more,  uh, you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by, uh, by, uh, uh, capital punishment?
4736	2	B	well i think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not,
4736	2	B	it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself.
4736	2	B	it's at that point where they're saying like here you're, you're going on death row
4736	33	B	but you'll stay there for twenty years.
4736	6	A	uh-huh.
4736	2	B	and nothing is being done about it.
4736	2	B	uh, the laws exist and are frequently upheld in, in, uh, in appeals court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find.
4736	2	B	and it's, it's really getting out of hand in many states.
4736	2	A	well, the term technicality .
4736	2	A	the law enforcement community,
4736	16	B	<Rustling>.
4736	7	A	uh, uh, you know, has to, has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which, uh, grievous  acts are done to, uh, to, you know, to get somebody into a, a situation where they're going to be guilty of, of a crime.
4736	16	B	<Noise>.
4736	2	A	or whether, uh,  an-, and whether  the rights of that individual are been, have been, you know, impuned.
4736	2	A	uh, but or whether there's just, you know, a policeman has just made a, uh, a, you know, a non, a noncritical error, though be it not the right way to do it
4736	2	A	but, but, you know, the, the merits of the case in terms of, you know,
4736	16	B	
4736	7	A	the guy was a law breaker, as being supportive.
4736	28	A	now, i, i'm, a-, a-, at this juncture
4736	4	A	i, you know,  i'm, i'm  not sure, you know, what constitutes a, a technicality.
4736	2	A	you know, that, that's what all c-, these, these hearings are about
4736	2	A	and that's what all these, you know, court cases are about.
4736	4	A	i mean our, uh, our, our glorious, uh, you know, mayor here in washington is six days away from getting out of, out of the can
4736	4	A	and, uh, you know, he, he tried to appeal his conviction. uh,
4736	4	A	and, you know, it didn't work.
4736	2	A	but be that as it may, everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry.
4736	4	A	uh, in, in the old days, you know, and say round about times of battle of hastings, you know, and the villages if you were a transgressor, they, they either, you know, drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody
4736	4	A	and he, you were his slave.
4736	4	A	and if he didn't like what you did, he killed you.
4736	16	B	<Noise>.
4736	2	A	and that has, that's pretty effective.
4736	2	A	uh, you know, it's not good for civil rights, i guess,
4736	2	A	but it's pretty effective in that, you know, you've got to get along in the community
4736	2	A	and if you don't you'll perish. either by the hand of your, your, your master or by being pushed out in the woods.
4736	2	A	so, i, i, i mean as, as man has gotten more complicated so all of the, uh, imaginations to, uh, you know, protect him from, from being, uh, dumped on by, uh, civilian authority in, in so-, in criminal actions, especially, you know, murder cases and that sort of thing.
4736	2	B	well, it seems like , well  it, it seems as if  in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished,
4736	2	B	and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes, albeit it seems that we are failing in that, in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off.
4736	4	B	um, for instance, um there's a case a few years back where, uh, someone, uh, someone who's being convicted for, was under a tri-, was going to trial for murder, was let off because of a technicality in that. the of-, the arresting officer, uh, did not read the defendant their rights.
4736	6	A	uh-huh.
4736	4	B	and where his,
4736	16	A	<Throat_clearing>.
4736	7	B	old evidence was there, the witnesses were there, the, everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet ,
4802	0	A	okay.
4802	13	A	uh, read any good books lately? .
4802	19	B	uh, yes,
4802	4	B	i, i've read, uh, several good books lately.
4802	4	B	uh, lot of them related to, uh, business and financial matters since that's what i do for a living.
4802	14	A	oh, okay.
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	1	B	how about yourself?
4802	21	A	uh, well i'm in graduate school
4802	23	A	and so i read a lot of books
4802	4	A	but i don't know if i consider very many of them good .
4802	16	B	<Laughter>.
4802	4	A	uh, i haven't read a book for enjoyment since, i guess, around christmas.
4802	4	A	uh, i re-, received, uh, uh, several books for christmas
4802	4	A	and at christmas break i read, uh, sarum by, uh, uh, a fellow named rutherford.
4802	6	B	yes.
4802	4	A	uh, it's the history of, uh,
4802	4	A	well it's sort of the his-, the historical fiction about, uh, the salisbury area in, in england.
4802	6	B	uh-huh.
4802	4	A	and so, i, i really enjoyed that book a lot.
4802	4	A	uh, he's not quite as good as, you know, michener or some of, uh, some of the other historical writers.
4802	4	A	but he, he did this job well,
4802	5	A	so.
4802	9	B	well, that sounds good.
4802	6	A	yeah.
4802	13	A	uh, do you find th-, do you find you have much chance to read for, for just pleasure or mostly for business?
4802	26	B	no,
4802	4	B	i read for pleasure some also.
4802	4	B	i read a book recently called iron john.
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	13	B	have you seen that by bly?
4802	36	A	i don't think i have seen it.
4802	14	B	okay.
4802	4	B	well it's a book about,
4802	16	A	<Noise>.
4802	7	B	uh, uh, greek gods and, and greek, uh, mythology
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	7	B	as well as, uh, man and interacting with other men and a book about, uh, men and how they mature through life.
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	6	A	# oh. #
4802	4	B	# and # how they deal with life itself .
4802	6	A	okay.
4802	4	A	i think i have heard about that.
4802	5	A	# yeah. #
4802	4	B	# but # it's, uh, it's all revolved around, uh, mythology.
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	7	B	uh, as far as, uh, traditions from, uh, other cultures and our culture.
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	7	B	and how we, uh, interact with one another.
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	6	A	yeah,
4802	9	A	that sounds great.
4802	13	A	did, did it have something to mention about, uh, sort of, uh, cultural rituals of, of manhood?
4802	19	B	yes.
4802	6	A	okay.
4802	6	A	yeah,
4802	4	A	i have heard of that.
4802	4	A	i have, uh, someone suggested that i read it.
4802	13	A	is it iron john?
4802	19	B	yes.
4802	14	A	okay.
4802	9	A	good.
4802	4	B	by bly,
4802	4	B	b l y, i believe it is.

4802	13	A	do you have a favorite subject to read, whether it be science fiction or, or history
4802	5	A	or,
4802	21	B	well, it depends again if we're talking about , uh,
4802	4	B	i read a lot of religious books.
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	7	B	uh, just because i have an interest in that area.
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	4	B	and i read a lot of books in the area of, uh, uh, psychology and self-help type, uh, materials.
4802	6	A	okay.
4802	4	B	uh, always trying to understand people
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	7	B	better and understand myself in relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because i'm in a people business.
4802	6	A	okay.
4802	5	B	and, uh, so that, that's,
4802	4	B	my work is my hobby .
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	4	A	# that #
4802	4	B	# # so i, i enjoy it.
4802	7	A	sounds great .
4802	20	A	uh, who is your, whose your favorite religious author?
4802	4	B	well, i don't know if i have a favorite
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	7	B	uh, religious author.
4802	4	B	i would have to say that, uh, some of the ones that consistently put out good materials,
4802	16	A	<Rustling>.
4802	7	B	uh, you know,
4802	2	B	that, that's difficult because one person might write one book extremely well and some other ones might not write as well.
4802	6	A	uh-huh.
4802	21	B	uh, i had to stop here and think a second.
4802	4	B	one of the ones that i've read recently that i've read several of his books
4802	4	B	and i thought that each one of his books were good.
4802	4	B	he's the man out of san antonio.
4802	5	B	and, uh,
4802	13	A	max lucado?
4802	16	A	<Noise>.
4802	4	B	max lucado.
4802	6	A	yeah.
4802	2	B	max consistently writes good books.
4802	6	A	yeah.
4802	2	A	uh, he's a great man.
4802	4	A	i've met him several times. uh,
4802	6	B	yes.
4802	4	B	i know him,
4802	5	B	yeah.
4802	6	A	huh.
4802	2	B	# but #
4802	6	A	# uh #
4802	7	B	uh, there's other authors also that have uh, uh, that write good books from time to time, but not consistently put out the materials all the time .
4802	7	A	uh-huh.
4802	2	B	uh, i'd say another, which is a local writer here in plano, uh, is, uh,
4802	21	B	i'm trying to think of his name.
4802	4	B	he's with the bible church.
4802	5	B	and that is, uh,
4802	21	B	, i see his name
4802	5	B	but i can't,
4802	4	B	i mean i see him
4802	4	B	but i can't see his name .
4802	4	B	but he, uh, he talks about,  uh, he talks about a lot of different topics
4802	5	B	and,
4890	2	A	uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. i, you know, i, i really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system has been, been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use. because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law.
4890	2	A	and if, if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they, they start, they could start going back and digging up all these cases that, uh, that would be handled differently # were #
4890	16	B	# . #
4890	7	A	they judged by today's standards.
4890	2	A	so i, i really don't think it, they can really do much of anything to change it.
4890	1	A	what do you think? .
4890	2	B	uh, i, i don't think so.
4890	2	B	possibly in the jury selection would be the only,
4890	16	A	<Bird_squawk>.
4890	4	B	just for example, what we're seeing in california i guess.
4890	2	B	it makes you wonder, uh, had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome.
4890	2	B	uh, and th-, and the problems that, that has come  that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating. uh just makes you wonder i guess # whether or not they, # -/ * seems as though this should be 2 slash units--the first ending after "beating."
4890	5	A	# well won't,
4890	2	A	well # maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that
4890	4	A	but  then --
4890	6	B	uh-huh.
4890	7	A	then,  you know, the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently #
4890	4	A	and, you know, the #
4890	2	B	# that's, that's bad . #
4890	7	A	other two guys sat in the car
4890	6	B	uh-huh.
4890	4	A	and they didn't get beat up.
4890	3	B	no.
4890	5	B	it ,
4890	7	A	you know.
4890	2	A	rodney got beat up because he, he, you know, he pur-, you know, he involved himself in some sub, self-destructive behavior.
4890	6	B	uh-huh.
4890	2	A	and, uh, uh, just like the burning and looting
4890	6	B	uh-huh.
4890	7	A	is self-destruct.
4890	2	A	# everybody #
4890	3	B	# oh, yes. #
4890	7	A	says well this is the nineties
4890	33	A	and they're going to rebuild
4890	33	A	and it'll be even better.
4890	8	A	hey, what do you think,
4890	8	A	you know, some, some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area?
4890	3	B	that's right.
4890	2	A	with everybody with that mind set. #   they,   they're # --
4890	2	B	# they're only going # to suffer.
4890	7	A	they're  going to,   that whole area is going to  be turned into residential ghetto, you know,
4890	2	A	and you might even be able to, to use it for, for a bombing test site, you know.
4890	2	B	t-, they're only going to suffer.
4890	2	B	they, they've defeated themselves with, with their looting and violence.
4890	4	B	uh, i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or, uh, don't live there or whatever, we all saw the same thing on the, on the tape
4890	5	B	and, uh,
4890	2	A	well e-, everybody is saying this is going to be a new era
4890	2	A	and we're going to reexamine this thing.
4890	2	A	hey, the b-, the average person is going to take a look at that and say, suspicions confirmed.
4890	33	A	they're a bunch of animals, you know.
4890	8	A	how can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything.
4890	4	A	forty deaths.
4890	4	A	i mean there are # forty people #
4890	3	B	# i know. #
4890	7	A	that are dead as a result of that.
4890	3	B	yeah,
4890	2	B	it's really ridiculous.
4890	4	A	and i'm just trying to determine, you know, how you address, how you weigh, you know, rodney getting, getting the hell beat out of him against, you know, forty deaths.
4890	29	B	against forty other people being,
4890	3	A	yeah.
4890	4	A	and there's no other,
4890	4	A	i'm not su-, exactly sure, uh, what the circumstances surrounding the deaths.
4890	4	A	and i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths
4890	30	B	those deaths.
4890	7	A	and, and pursued it, you know, because i'm interested in the circumstances surrounding # this thing. #
4890	6	B	# uh-huh. #
4890	13	A	is it a looter that got shot by a store owner?
4890	5	A	# i, you know,
4890	0	A	no tears. #
4890	13	B	# or just a by-, # an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what.
4890	6	A	yeah.
4890	4	A	# and # --
4890	5	B	# um. #
4890	7	A	and so  i,  but  i,
4890	16	B	<Noise>.
4890	7	A	i   suspect a number of them.
4890	4	A	you know, you, you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot, you know, in, in the street.
4890	24	B	or, or beaten.
4890	4	A	and, and my reaction is i would have run over fifty people before, rather than stop.
4890	4	A	and, uh, and there, there would have been just nothing but carnage after, after, after
4890	5	B	um .
4890	7	A	if i'd been at the wheel.
4890	4	A	# no one #
4890	6	B	# right. #
4890	7	A	would have stopped me.
4890	3	B	that's, that's exactly how i feel too.
4890	4	B	i wouldn't have, uh, they wouldn't have stopped my car for any, anything had i seen them coming.
4890	2	B	but i was just wondering since you're, you're in, you're back east, uh, and a little closer to the, the bigger cities than we are in idaho here.
4890	3	A	right.
4890	4	A	i'm inside the beltway.
4890	6	B	oh.
4890	4	A	you know how capital gang, they always say well inside the beltway, they think thus
4890	4	A	and so and i say well wait a minute,
4890	33	A	i'm inside the beltway
4890	33	A	and i don't think like that.
4890	6	B	uh-huh.
4890	4	A	i'm a government employee.
4890	6	B	oh.
4890	20	B	in what, uh, section of the government # do you work? #
4890	4	A	# i'm with # the f b i.
4890	6	B	oh .
4890	9	B	oh, that's interesting .
4890	3	A	yes.
4890	4	A	an-, and so, uh, uh, and, and the reason i'm doing this whole thing is because rick,
4890	16	B	<Talking>.
4890	7	A	whose another government employee wanted a spe-, segments of my speech,
4890	16	B	<Noise>.
4890	7	A	that --
4890	6	B	uh-huh.
4890	7	A	that  were done a year ago
4890	4	A	and he wanted another collection a year later.
4890	6	B	oh.
4890	4	A	and so this is my seventh call.
4890	4	A	a year ago i did eleven calls.
4890	14	B	oh, i see .
4890	4	A	and so that's, that's why, uh, uh, that's why i'm religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique, you know, i have a unique situation here in that if i don't participate,
4917	2	A	an interesting topic.
4917	3	B	yes.
4917	16	A	<Laughter>.
4917	4	B	the, uh, type of cars that i was, uh, i would be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a, uh, mazda miata.
4917	6	A	uh-huh.
4917	5	B	uh, the, uh,
4917	4	B	i'm very much a, a fan of sports cars.
4917	9	A	ah.
4917	2	A	# boy, #
4917	5	B	# the, #
4917	7	A	you and my husband would have a whole lot in common # . #
4917	5	B	# # the, uh,
4917	16	A	<Child>.
4917	5	B	uh, uh, though, actually, in som-,
4917	5	B	actually if i h-,
4917	5	B	i have av-,
4917	4	B	i've avoided buying a new car for quite some time.
4917	4	B	i'd rather put my money into, uh,
4917	16	A	<Rustling>.
4917	7	B	restoring my old cars.
4917	4	B	i have a old triumph t r six.
4917	6	A	uh-huh.
4917	5	B	and, uh, uh, so, uh,
4917	4	B	but if i was to buy one, probably something like a miata.
4917	5	B	it's certainly,
4917	5	B	i-,
4917	4	B	i wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time .
4917	18	A	oh, really.
4917	19	B	yeah
4917	16	B	<laughter>.
4917	5	A	what's the,
4917	20	A	how old is your car?
4917	4	B	uh, well i have a, i have a nineteen eighty, uh, eighty-five c r x.
4917	6	A	oh.
4917	4	B	uh, which is, you know, # it's,
4917	4	B	it still works fine . #
4917	6	A	# yeah.
4917	6	A	right. #
4917	4	B	but it's, it's actually, # it's kind of annoying cause i've got no reason to replace it . #
4917	6	A	# oh. #
4917	5	B	but, uh,
4917	6	A	yeah.
4917	20	A	so what do the miatas run?
4917	7	B	oh, those are,
4917	4	B	they're about, uh, uh, thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and, you know, a bit more if you add some some options # and so on
4917	5	B	but #
4917	2	A	# well, that's not # too bad.
4917	7	B	the,
4917	3	B	uh, yeah,
4917	2	B	that's a pretty good price #
4917	4	B	and #
4917	6	A	# yeah. #
4917	7	B	they're, they're, they're, they're so nice to drive.
4917	18	A	really?
4917	4	A	i've never driven one.
4917	4	B	uh, uh, it's, it's, it's nice.
4917	5	B	they're,
4917	4	B	i've been down to a dealer and driven them.
4917	4	B	and i've also driven one at a, something mazda put on where, uh, they went to, uh, autocross events across the country. uh, which is where you race in, uh, you race on, in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of, uh, cones to see who can get through the fastest.
4917	32	A	huh?
4917	4	B	uh, you know, about a minute or so.
4917	6	A	uh-huh.
4917	7	B	and, uh, very twisty stuff.
4917	4	B	and oh, it handles so nicely.
4917	13	A	and so you've done this?
4917	19	B	yeah.
4917	6	A	oh.
4917	14	A	okay.
4917	6	B	yeah.
4917	6	A	# oh . #
4917	5	B	# it # was just,
4917	4	B	it, it's just so smooth #
4917	5	B	and. #
4917	18	A	# really?
4917	5	A	yeah
4917	16	A	. #
4917	3	B	yeah.
4917	2	B	nice car.
4917	20	B	what are you interested in?
4917	4	A	whatever my husband buys # . #
4917	6	B	# yeah.
4917	13	B	you # you don't get involved in, # uh, car decisions? #
4917	36	A	# oh, not too much. #
4917	26	A	no.
4917	4	A	we, uh, we just got rid of a full conversion van that, that i, i, i-, that wasn't me.
4917	4	A	that was my husband.
4917	16	B	<Laughter>.
4917	4	A	he wanted a van
4917	4	A	and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there. t v, you know, the whole bit.
4917	16	B	<Laughter>.
4917	4	A	but i never drove it
4917	4	A	so it just, it wasn't me, you know.
4917	6	B	yeah.
4917	9	B	i can understand.
4917	0	B	# well would # -- *slash error should be qw
4917	4	A	# and then, #
4917	7	B	you want, if you had to decide, what would you want?
4917	7	A	oh, i'd want a minivan # . #
4917	0	B	# okay, / *slash error should be bk
4917	6	B	yeah.
4917	2	B	# # they're nice. #
4917	4	A	# because i'm # with the kids all the time.
4917	3	B	oh, yeah.
4917	2	B	# that's #
4917	6	A	# yeah. #
4917	7	B	perfect for that.
4917	6	A	# yeah.
4917	5	A	and, #
4917	5	B	# it's not,
4917	2	B	# it, it's small enough that it's easy to drive.
4917	3	A	yeah.
4917	4	A	#  you pick up  #
4917	2	B	# holds a lot. #
4917	7	A	i pick up  my little one from preschool
4917	4	A	and the whole parking lot's full of minivans.
4917	6	B	yeah.
4917	4	A	but, you know, i, i drive a little subaru.
4917	6	B	yeah.
4917	4	A	and, uh, we, i love that.
4917	5	A	i,
4917	4	A	we were going to trade that in for the van
4917	4	A	but i just wanted to hold on to it cause i just really enjoy that.
4917	6	B	right.
4917	4	A	and, uh, that's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there # and back. #
4917	6	B	# yeah.
4917	2	B	# minivans are nice.
4917	4	B	i have a friend who has a minivan.
4917	6	A	uh-huh.
4917	4	B	and, uh, i've driven it a few times
4917	4	B	and, uh, i-, it's nice,
4917	4	B	it's nice.
4917	4	B	of course, you know, my fam-, my family has always had cars like that. uh, in that, you know, my father's had a, had a, always had a v w bus every since, uh
4917	6	A	oh, really .
4917	7	B	nine, about nineteen sixty or so.
4917	6	A	oh, really.
4917	5	B	uh, # uh, #
4917	16	A	# . #
4917	5	B	they, well,
4917	4	B	he, he used it,
4917	4	B	he often has to transport  plants or, uh, # things #
4917	6	A	# yeah. #
4917	7	B	like that cause he's, he goes to orchid shows and, and, you know, fills the car with plants. and so on
4917	5	B	or .
4917	6	A	yeah.
4917	2	A	it's amazing what a minivan can do.
4917	4	A	we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan.
4917	6	B	uh-huh.
4917	7	A	and pulled the, uh, the little trailer behind.
4917	6	B	uh-huh.
4917	13	A	the pop-up trailer?
4917	19	B	uh-huh.
4917	5	A	and, uh, it's,
4917	2	A	so it's really amazing how much a minivan c-, you know, what it can do.
4917	3	B	yeah.
4917	2	B	and they're not that expensive.
4917	3	A	no,
4917	2	A	they're not.
4917	6	B	yeah.
4917	5	A	they're probably # . #
4917	2	B	# mainly because everyone # makes them, you know .
4917	6	A	yeah.
4917	2	B	you can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be.
4917	3	A	yeah.
4917	4	A	and we, we do a lot of, uh, driving.
4917	4	A	we do a lot of traveling.
4917	6	B	uh-huh
4917	16	B	<<very faint>>.
4917	7	A	by car.
4917	4	A	and so that's the only time that the, that the, uh, conversion van came in handy.
4917	4	A	but it really didn't cause our, our kids are still little.
4917	6	B	uh-huh.
4917	4	A	so, uh, that was the only time we really needed it.
4917	4	A	other than that, it got terrible mileage
4917	5	A	and.
4917	6	B	yeah
4917	6	B	. yeah.
4917	2	B	minivans d-, do pretty well.
4917	6	A	yeah.
4917	7	B	you know, twenty, twenty, twenty-five miles per gallon or more.
4917	6	A	yeah.
4917	4	B	some of them probably even do thirty.
4917	6	A	yeah.
4917	5	B	the, uh,
4917	5	B	yeah.
4917	4	B	there, there's some other cars i'd like
4917	4	B	but i,  u-, u-, i  would never be willing to send quite that much money for, uh, like, uh, uh,
4917	4	B	i'll drool over them.
